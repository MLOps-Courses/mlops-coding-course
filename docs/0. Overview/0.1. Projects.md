# 0.1. Projects

## What is default project for the course?

The default project for this course involves a forecasting challenge using the Bike Sharing Dataset. The objective is to predict the number of bike rentals based on various factors including date and time, weather conditions, and previous rental demands.

Forecasting is a common and relevant task in both academic and industrial settings, employing various machine learning algorithms. These time-sensitive projects present unique challenges, such as managing data subsets to prevent data leakage—using future information to predict past data. This project serves as an excellent case study to practice effective MLOps project organization methodologies.

## Can I choose my own project?

Absolutely! We encourage you to select a personal project whenever feasible. This could be something you're currently working on professionally, or a passion project you're interested in developing. Working on your own project allows you to concentrate on enhancing the development process with your existing domain knowledge, rather than getting acquainted with new project content.

## Where can I get inspiration?

If you're looking for inspiration, several platforms host data science competitions with well-defined problems and datasets to get you started:

- Kaggle: The largest global data science community, offering tools and resources to achieve your data science ambitions.
- DrivenData: Hosts competitions for data scientists to address the world's biggest challenges with innovative predictive models.
i- DataCamp: Offers real-world data science competitions to hone your skills and win prizes, showcasing your notebooks.

## Can I work on an LLM project?

While Large Language Model (LLM) and generative AI projects share similarities with predictive machine learning tasks—such as model management and benefiting from improved code structure—they also have distinct characteristics. LLM evaluation can be more intricate, possibly requiring external LLMs for scalable and thorough testing. Training and fine-tuning practices differ significantly as well, often demanding advanced hardware, like high-memory Nvidia GPUs.

In summary, it might be more straightforward to begin with a predictive ML project and later apply the learned practices to an LLM project.
