# 0.1. Projects

## What is the default learning project?

This course's default project is a forecasting task using the [Bike Sharing Demand dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand). Your goal is to predict bike rental demand based on factors like weather and time. A [reference implementation](https://github.com/fmind/mlops-python-package) is available if you need guidance.

Forecasting is an ideal starting point for MLOps because it mirrors many real-world business problems and introduces common challenges. You will learn to handle time-series data, prevent [data leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(machine_learning)) by correctly partitioning data, and build a robust pipeline from feature engineering to model deployment. This project provides a solid foundation in MLOps principles that is transferable to other domains.

## Can I use my own project instead?

Yes, you are highly encouraged to use a personal or professional project. Applying the course concepts to a domain you already understand can accelerate your learning and deliver immediate value.

Working on your own project allows you to:
-   Directly improve a system you are passionate about.
-   Avoid the learning curve of a new dataset and problem space.
-   Build a portfolio piece that is uniquely yours.

## How can I find good project ideas?

If you're looking for inspiration, data science competition platforms are excellent sources for well-defined problems with ready-to-use datasets:

-   **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)**: A premier platform for data science competitions, datasets, and community collaboration.
-   **[DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/)**: Focuses on social impact projects, allowing you to use your skills for good.
-   **[Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets)**: Offers thousands of datasets, ideal for projects in NLP, computer vision, and audio.

## What makes a project suitable for this MLOps course?

Whether you choose the default project or your own, a good project for learning MLOps should have:

-   **A Clear Objective**: A well-defined goal, such as improving a business metric or solving a specific problem.
-   **Accessible Data**: Data that is readily available and sufficient for training a model.
-   **Deployment Potential**: The model should be something you can imagine deploying, even if in a simulated environment.
-   **Measurable Outcomes**: Clear metrics to evaluate model performance and project success.

## Can I work on a Large Language Model (LLM) project?

While this course focuses on traditional predictive ML, the MLOps principles you'll learn—like versioning, automation, and monitoring—are foundational and applicable to [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) projects.

However, [Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) introduces unique challenges not covered in depth here, such as:

-   **Specialized Infrastructure**: Requiring powerful GPUs for fine-tuning and inference.
-   **Complex Evaluation**: Moving beyond simple accuracy to metrics like BLEU/ROUGE or even LLM-based evaluations.
-   **New Techniques**: Involving prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and vector databases.

For these reasons, we recommend starting with a predictive ML project to master core MLOps fundamentals before tackling the complexities of LLM Operations (LLMOps).
