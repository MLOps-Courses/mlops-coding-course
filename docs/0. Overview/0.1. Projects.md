# 0.1. Projects

## What is the default project for this course?

The standard project for this course focuses on a forecasting task using the Bike Sharing Dataset. This project aims to predict bike rental numbers based on a range of factors, such as date and time, weather conditions, and historical rental data.

Forecasting tasks are prevalent in both academic research and real-world applications, employing various machine learning techniques. Projects like these come with specific challenges, including the management of data subsets to avoid data leakage—where future data inadvertently informs past predictions. Through this project, you will gain practical experience in organizing MLOps projects effectively, making it an ideal learning tool.

## Can I choose my own project?

Yes, you are highly encouraged to work on a project of your own choice. This can be a project you're involved in at work or a personal interest project you're passionate about developing. Using your own project allows you to focus on improving the development process with the domain knowledge you already possess, instead of spending time getting to know a new project's specifics.

## Where can I find inspiration?

If you're searching for project inspiration, there are several platforms where data science challenges are hosted, complete with datasets and well-defined problems:

- **Kaggle**: Home to a global data science community, Kaggle offers tools and resources to support your data science goals.
- **DrivenData**: This platform runs competitions for data scientists to tackle significant global issues through creative predictive modeling.
- **DataCamp**: Known for its real-world data science competitions, DataCamp allows you to sharpen your skills, win prizes, and showcase your work.

## Can I work on an LLM project?

While projects centered around Large Language Models (LLM) and generative AI share some common ground with predictive ML projects—like the necessity for robust model management and code organization—they also possess unique challenges. Evaluating LLMs can be more complex, potentially requiring the use of external LLMs for comprehensive testing. Moreover, training and fine-tuning LLMs usually require specialized hardware, such as high-memory GPUs, and involve different practices compared to typical ML tasks.

Given these distinctions, it may be more practical to start with a predictive ML project to familiarize yourself with essential MLOps practices. These foundational skills can later be adapted and applied to LLM projects, facilitating a smoother transition to more specialized tasks.
