# 0. Overview

Welcome to the course! Our aim is to sharpen your skills in creating robust Python codebases for AI and Machine Learning (ML) initiatives. We start by transitioning from the exploratory phase of notebook prototypes to the structured domain of Python packages. This shift is crucial for embedding high-quality coding standards and automation practices into your workflow, making your projects not only more efficient but also scalable.
