## What is this course about?

This course is designed to guide you through the process of transforming Python code from simple scripts to a sophisticated, production-ready AI/ML codebase. The curriculum focuses on:

- Constructing and deploying software artifacts suitable for production environments.
- Moving beyond initial prototyping in notebooks to develop organized Python packages.
- Improving code reliability and maintainability using tools for linting and testing.
- Simplifying and automating repetitive tasks, either on your local machine or through CI/CD pipelines.
- Applying industry best practices to create a flexible and robust AI/ML codebase.

## Why should I enroll in this course?

As AI and ML technologies increasingly permeate software applications, the complexity of these projects grows, presenting challenges in model management, dataset handling, and complex code organization. This course seeks to fill the gap between software developers and data scientists, equipping you with the skills necessary to adeptly manage and deliver AI/ML projects.

The course emphasizes the importance of transitioning from the common practice of using notebooks for production, which can lack robust software development practices, to properly structured codebases. This shift can mitigate production challenges, improve collaboration, and increase the maturity of your MLOps practices.

## What are the course's prerequisites?

Before starting, you should have:

1. A basic understanding of Python programming, including constructs like loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.
2. Some familiarity with using the terminal for tasks such as software installation, following README instructions, and starting applications.
3. An introductory level of data science knowledge, encompassing data exploration, feature engineering, model training and tuning, and evaluation.

## What will I learn in this course?

The course is structured into six detailed chapters, each aimed at enhancing different aspects of your coding and project management capabilities:

1. **Initializing**: Setting up your development environment with essential tools and platforms.
2. **Prototyping**: Starting with notebooks to explore data science projects and identify potential solutions.
3. **Refactoring**: Evolving your prototype into a well-organized Python package, including scripts, configuration files, and documentation.
4. **Validating**: Implementing practices like typing, linting, testing, and logging to improve code quality.
5. **Refining**: Applying advanced software development techniques and tools to further enhance your project.
6. **Collaborating**: Creating a collaborative environment for efficient team contributions and communication.

## What is not covered in this course?

While this course lays a strong foundation for managing AI/ML projects, it does not cover specific MLOps platforms like SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML, or Databricks. Instead, it focuses on essential principles and practices that are applicable across various platforms, whether on-premises, cloud-based, or a combination of both.

## How long does it take to complete this course?

Completion time varies depending on your prior experience and familiarity with the tools and practices covered. If you're already acquainted with some of the tools like git or VS Code, you can navigate the content more swiftly. The course adopts a philosophy of incremental improvement—"make it done, make it right, make it fast"—encouraging you to start with a functional project version and progressively refine it to enhance quality and efficiency.
