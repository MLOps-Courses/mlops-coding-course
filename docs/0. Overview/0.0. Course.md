# 0.0. Course

## What will this course teach you?

This course will transform your AI/ML projects from experimental notebooks into production-grade, reliable software. You will master the essential skills to:

-   Structure, package, and deploy robust AI/ML applications.
-   Transition from prototyping in notebooks to creating maintainable Python packages.
-   Implement validation techniques like linting, testing, and typing to ensure code quality.
-   Automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows with local tooling and CI/CD pipelines.
-   Apply software engineering best practices to build scalable and resilient MLOps solutions.

## Who is this course for?

This course is designed for professionals seeking to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering. It is ideal for:

-   **Data Scientists** who want to learn software engineering best practices to build and deploy production-ready models.
-   **Software Developers** who are transitioning into AI/ML engineering roles and need to understand the full MLOps lifecycle.
-   **AI/ML Engineers** looking to standardize their workflows and adopt industry-leading coding practices.

## Why enroll in this course?

The demand for professionals who can navigate the complexities of models, data, and code has never been higher. This course provides a clear, practical path to mastering MLOps by focusing on a critical, often-overlooked skill: transforming research-oriented notebooks into structured, production-quality code. By moving beyond notebooks, you will learn to build more reliable systems, collaborate more effectively, and accelerate your career in the AI/ML field.

## What is the learning philosophy?

We believe in a practical, iterative approach to learning, summarized by the mantra: "Make it work, make it right, make it fast."

1.  **Make it work:** First, focus on building a functional solution to understand the core problem.
2.  **Make it right:** Next, refactor and improve your code, applying best practices for structure, readability, and maintainability.
3.  **Make it fast:** Finally, optimize your solution for performance and efficiency.

This philosophy encourages incremental progress, ensuring you build a solid foundation before tackling more advanced concepts.

## What skills will you acquire?

The curriculum is structured into seven chapters, each designed to build upon the last and equip you with critical project management and coding skills:

1.  **[Initializing](../../1. Initializing/)**: Set up a professional development environment with essential tools and platforms.
2.  **[Prototyping](../../2. Prototyping/)**: Use notebooks to rapidly explore datasets, experiment with models, and identify viable solutions.
3.  **[Productionizing](../../3. Productionizing/)**: Convert your prototype into a structured Python package with clear entrypoints, configurations, and documentation.
4.  **[Validating](../../4. Validating/)**: Ensure code reliability and correctness by implementing static typing, linting, comprehensive testing, and structured logging.
5.  **[Refining](../../5. Refining/)**: Polish your project with advanced software development techniques, including design patterns, task automation, and CI/CD workflows.
6.  **[Sharing](../../6. Sharing/)**: Create a collaborative and well-documented repository that encourages effective teamwork and contributions.
7.  **[Observability](../../7. Observability/)**: Implement tools and practices for monitoring your data, models, and infrastructure to ensure performance and reliability.

## What are the prerequisites?

To succeed in this course, you should have a foundational knowledge in the following areas:

1.  **Python Proficiency:** A solid grasp of Python fundamentals, including data structures, control flow, functions, and classes.
2.  **Terminal/CLI Familiarity:** Comfort using the command line to install software, run commands, and navigate the file system.
3.  **Data Science Basics:** A general understanding of the data science workflow, from data exploration and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

## What's beyond the scope of this course?

This course focuses on teaching foundational, platform-agnostic MLOps principles. While we provide a strong basis for managing AI/ML codebases, we do not cover the specific implementations of vendor platforms like [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/), [Azure ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning/), or [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/). Our goal is to equip you with universally applicable skills that empower you to work effectively in any on-premise, cloud, or hybrid environment.

## How much time is required?

The time commitment depends on your existing experience. If you are already familiar with tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you will likely progress more quickly. The course is self-paced, allowing you to invest time according to your schedule. Following our iterative learning philosophy, you can quickly build an initial version of your project and then progressively enhance it, ensuring a steady and rewarding learning curve.
