# 0.6. Resources

## Is there additional project resources?

This course is supplemented with a variety of resources aimed at enriching your MLOps learning journey. A key resource is the **[MLOps Python Package](https://github.com/fmind/mlops-python-package)**, designed to exemplify how to structure an MLOps codebase efficiently. This package incorporates the dataset featured in the course, providing a holistic view of what your end project could resemble.

For those seeking to deepen their knowledge in specific areas, the course creators have also contributed insights through [personal blog posts](https://fmind.medium.com/). These articles explore subjects like setting up [Visual Studio Code for MLOps activities](https://fmind.medium.com/how-to-configure-vs-code-for-ai-ml-and-mlops-development-in-python-%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F-8582d8c6ea54) or [employing Pydantic for robust data validation](https://fmind.medium.com/make-your-mlops-code-base-solid-with-pydantic-and-pythons-abc-aeedfe9c3e65). Such resources offer additional insights and actionable advice to enhance your understanding and skills.
