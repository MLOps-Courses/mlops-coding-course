# 0.6. Resources

## Is there additional project resources?

Yes, indeed! The cornerstone resource for this course is the MLOps Python Package. This repository is designed as a hands-on illustration of structuring an MLOps codebase. It leverages the dataset weâ€™ve been discussing throughout the course, providing a glimpse into what your final project could resemble.

For those keen on diving deeper into specific subjects, such as configuring VS Code or understanding Pydantic better, the course creators offer extensive insights through their personal blog. These posts explore these topics in greater depth.

## Can I suggest a new project resource?

Certainly! The course operates on an open-source philosophy, welcoming contributions that enrich the learning journey. If you have resources to suggest or wish to highlight some that have already been discussed in the course, your input is valued and encouraged.
