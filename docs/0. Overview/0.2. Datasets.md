## What is a dataset?

A dataset is a collection of data systematically organized for analysis, forming the foundation for any AI/ML project. Its structure can vary, but its role in defining the project's boundaries, capabilities, and challenges is critical. Machine Learning engineers often find themselves investing significant effort in data preparation, adhering to the principle that 80% of the work involves processing data, while only 20% focuses on modeling. Typically, industrial projects begin with raw data that requires extensive cleaning and exploration before advancing to the modeling stage.

Datasets are crucial at every stage of a machine learning project, with their quality and size profoundly affecting model outcomes, often more than the tweaking of the models themselves.

## When is the dataset used?

Datasets play a vital role throughout the entire AI/ML project lifecycle, including:

- **Exploration**: Gaining insights into your data, examining relationships between variables, and understanding patterns that may influence predictions.
- **Data Processing**: Developing features that capture the predictive essence of the context and adequately splitting the dataset to prepare for modeling.
- **Model Tuning**: Adjusting model hyperparameters through techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's ability to generalize.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing how well the model performs on previously unseen data and pinpointing opportunities for enhancement.

## What are the types of datasets?

Datasets can generally be categorized into structured, unstructured, and semi-structured types, each with its own characteristics:

### Structured Data

Such data adhere to a specific schema, making them easier to organize and analyze.

- **Tabular Data**: Consists of rows and columns, with each column containing data of the same type. It is commonly found in CSV files and databases.
- **Time Series Data**: Sequential data points collected over consistent time intervals. The order of the data points is critical and altering it can change the dataset's meaning, making it indispensable in fields like finance and energy forecasting.
- **Geospatial Data**: Pertains to specific locations or areas on Earth, essential for spatial analysis and often managed with Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
- **Graph Data**: Includes nodes (vertices) and edges (connections), used to represent entities and their relationships. It's pivotal for modeling complex networks and systems.

### Unstructured Data

This type of data doesn't follow a predefined format, posing challenges in processing and interpretation.

- **Text**: Can range from short texts to comprehensive documents, characterized by its vast diversity and the complexity of language.
- **Multimedia**: Encompasses images, audio, and video, notable for their high dimensionality and the challenges associated with extracting actionable insights.

### Semi-Structured Data

Falling between structured and unstructured data, semi-structured data doesn't conform to a rigid schema but includes tags or markers that help identify certain elements, making it easier to parse. JSON and XML are common examples.

## Which dataset should I use?

Choosing the right dataset often leads to the question of familiarity versus novelty. The simplest guidance is: the most effective dataset is the one you understand the best. Despite the variety in data types and their respective applications, the fundamental principles of MLOps apply universally across different fields. Thus, starting with a dataset you're comfortable with allows you to focus on mastering MLOps practices rather than navigating the intricacies of unfamiliar data.
