# 0.2. Datasets

## What is a dataset?

A dataset is a structured collection of data, essential for initiating any AI/ML project. It can vary in form and structure but is crucial for understanding the project's scope, strengths, and limitations. A proficient ML engineer often dedicates more time to data processing than to modeling, adhering to the 80-20 rule. It's common for industrial projects to start with raw datasets that require thorough cleaning and exploration before proceeding to the modeling phase.

Datasets are the backbone of machine learning, playing a pivotal role at every project stage. The quality and volume of your data significantly influence the performance of your models, often more than fine-tuning the models themselves.

## When is the dataset used?

Datasets are integral throughout the lifecycle of an AI/ML project, including:

- Exploration: Understanding your data, examining the relationships between input variables and the target prediction (correlations, etc.).
- Data Processing: Crafting optimal features to encapsulate the predictive context and meaningfully splitting your data.
- Model Tuning: Optimizing model hyperparameters with cross-validation to ensure generalizability.
- Model Evaluation: Determining your model's performance on unseen data and identifying areas of improvement.

## What are the types of dataset?

Datasets can be broadly classified into structured, unstructured, and semi-structured categories:

### Structured Data

This data conforms to a predefined schema, facilitating easier organization and retrieval.

- Tabular Data: Organized in rows and columns, with each column being type-homogeneous. Commonly found in CSV files and relational databases.
- Time Series Data: Data points collected over time at consistent intervals. The sequence of data is vital, as altering it can change the dataset's meaning. Often used in financial and energy data analysis.
- Geospatial Data: Represents specific locations or geographical areas on Earth, crucial for analyzing spatial relationships and patterns, and commonly managed with Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
- Graph Data: Comprises vertices and edges, representing entities and their interrelations. Graph data can model complex networks and systems, and may be directed, undirected, weighted, or cyclic.

### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data lack a predefined format, making it more challenging to process and interpret.

- Text: Ranges from simple strings to entire books, characterized by a vast vocabulary and inherent ambiguities.
- Multimedia: Includes images, audio, and video. The complexity lies in their high dimensionality, file size, and the difficulty of extracting meaningful insights.

### Semi Structured Data

Though not adhering to a strict data model like structured data, semi-structured data includes markers or tags to delineate semantic elements, simplifying parsing. Examples include XML and JSON files.

## Which dataset should I use?

Selecting the right dataset is a common question, and the simple answer is: the best dataset is the one you're most familiar with. Despite the array of data types and applications, the core concepts of MLOps are universally applicable across different domains.
