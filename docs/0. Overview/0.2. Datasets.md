# 0.2. Datasets

Data is often referred to as the fuel for Machine Learning, and although this course focuses on MLOps, it's crucial to have access to data to fully grasp the various concepts and technologies involved.

## Types of Data

When mentionning data, the first point is perhaps what are we talking about. When exploiting the model, data will be required at every step and will take many forms, be stored on different supports and will have different properties.

Briefly we can note the following data types:

### Structured Data
Structured data adheres to a predefined model, making it easier to search and organize.

* *Tabular*:
    Perhaps the most common type of data, where data is organize in rows and columns.
    * Column are homogeneous in terms of types
    * Typically CSV files and Relational database
* *Time Series*:
    Sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time, usually at consistent intervals.
    * Characterized by temporal order, meaning the sequence of observations is crucial, and changing the order can alter the meaning or interpretation of the data.
    * Typically, financial data and energy
* *Geospatial*:
    Data representing a specific location or geographic area on earth
    * Can be represented as latitude, longitude or other type of geographic indicators
    * Useful to anlyse and visual spatial relationship and patterns
    * Typically handled by Geographic Information System (GIS)
* *Graph*
    Data are organised around vertices and edges that connects them representing entities and relationships between them.
    * useful to model complex networks and many real workd syste,s
    * graph can be directed, undirected , weighted, multiple, cyclic, acyclic


### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data does not follow a predefined model, making it more complex to process.

* *Text*:
    The most common form of unstructured data corresponding to written content.
    * can be simple strings to entire book
    * characterized by high number of unique words, contextual meaning and ambiguity
* *Multimedia*:
    Refer to picture, sound, video data
    * challenging due to the high dimensionality, large file sizes, and the complexity of extracting meaningful patterns.

### Semi Structured Data

Data that does not conform to a rigid data model like structured data, but it does contain tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields, making it easier to parse than unstructured data.
Examples are XML and JSON files.



## Which data should I use?

The question of which dataset to use is common, and honestly, the best dataset is the one you're most familiar with.
While the vast array of data types and their diverse applications might seem overwhelming, it's important to remember that many MLOps concepts are universal and can be applied across different domains.

We will look into the specificities of certain types of applications later in the course. For now, we offer two options for getting started.

### Option 1: Use your own dataset (recommended)

Whenever possible, applying what you learn to your own dataset is highly recommended. This approach has several advantages:

* Relevance: Working with your data means the insights and models you develop are immediately applicable to your projects or interests.
* Familiarity: You are likely more familiar with the specificties of your own data, which will ease the analysis and troubleshooting.
* Customization: It allows you to tailor the MLOps processes and solutions directly to your context.

### Option 2: Use a dataset from Kaggle

If you don't have your own dataset or are looking for a new challenge, we recommend starting with a well-documented and widely-used public dataset. For this course, we suggest the following dataset from Kaggle:
