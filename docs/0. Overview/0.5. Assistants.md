# 0.5. Assistants

## What is the course assistant?

This course includes a dedicated OpenAI GPT-based assistant, designed to address your queries and customize the course content according to your preferences. It operates similarly to ChatGPT but is specifically tailored to understand and interact with the material covered in this course.

Please note, access to this assistant feature is part of a subscription to ChatGPT services, priced at approximately $20 per month.

## How should I use the assistant?

The assistant is at your disposal for any course-related inquiries. You might consider asking questions such as:

- Could you demonstrate a pipeline example for PyTorch?
- What's the best approach to feature creation for my dataset?
- Can you explain the advantages of implementing unit tests?

Furthermore, the assistant can review your code, offering critiques and suggestions on the content you've developed.

## Can I fully trust the assistant?

It's important to exercise caution when relying on the assistant's outputs. Although it's designed to be accurate, with around 90% of its content expected to be correct, there's a possibility of encountering inaccuracies or contextually inappropriate responses due to the nature of generative AI technology.

For those seeking a blend of AI convenience and human insight, the option for [human mentoring](0.4. Mentoring.md) is available. This provides an opportunity to enhance the assistant's guidance with personalized, expert feedback.
