# 0.5. Assistants

## What is the course assistant?

This course includes a dedicated OpenAI GPT-based assistant, designed to address your queries and customize the course content according to your preferences. It operates similarly to ChatGPT but is specifically tailored to understand and interact with the material covered in this course.

Please note, access to this assistant feature is part of a subscription to ChatGPT services, priced at approximately $20 per month.

## How does this assistant work?

The course assistant functions by leveraging OpenAI's GPT technology to provide real-time assistance and personalized feedback. When you submit a query or request for assistance, the system processes your input using advanced natural language understanding techniques. It then searches its extensive knowledge base for relevant information or examples to provide you with the most accurate and helpful response possible.

This assistant is continuously updated with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for your MLOps learning journey. Whether you need clarification on a concept, examples of MLOps practices, or feedback on your code, the assistant is equipped to support you.

## How should I use the assistant?

The assistant is at your disposal for any course-related inquiries. Here are some ways you might consider using it:

- **Demonstrating Examples:** Request specific examples, like a pipeline example for PyTorch, to understand concepts better.
- **Feature Creation Guidance:** Ask for advice on creating features for your dataset, leveraging the assistant's knowledge to enhance your project.
- **Understanding Best Practices:** Inquire about the advantages of implementing unit tests or other best practices in MLOps.

Additionally, the assistant can review your code, offering critiques and suggestions to improve the quality and efficiency of your work.

## Can I fully trust the assistant?

While the assistant is designed to provide accurate and contextually appropriate responses, it's crucial to approach its outputs with a critical eye. Approximately 90% of the content it generates is expected to be correct, but there's always a risk of inaccuracies or contextually inappropriate advice due to the inherent limitations of generative AI technology.

For those seeking a more reliable source of information, combining the convenience of AI with human expertise, the \[human mentoring\](0.4. Mentoring.md) option is available. This service offers a way to supplement the assistant's guidance with personalized feedback and insights from experienced professionals in the field.
