## What is an MLOps platform?

An MLOps platform is an integrated suite of technologies designed to support the deployment, management, and operationalization of AI and ML projects in production environments. Key components typically include:

- **Storage Systems**: Such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, for storing datasets, models, and other artifacts.
- **Compute Engines**: Like Kubernetes or Databricks, providing the computational resources needed to train models and run predictions.
- **Orchestrators**: Tools such as Apache Airflow, Metaflow, or Prefect, which automate and manage workflows and data pipelines.
- **Model Registries**: Platforms like MLflow, Neptune.ai, or Weights and Biases, for tracking and versioning models.

The scale and complexity of an MLOps platform can vary significantly, depending on the needs of the organization and specific project requirements. Smaller organizations might prioritize open-source solutions, like MLflow for model lifecycle management and Airflow for orchestration, due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness. In contrast, larger enterprises may opt for comprehensive, managed solutions like Databricks or AWS SageMaker to support large-scale AI/ML deployments.

## Which MLOps platform is the best?

Choosing the "best" MLOps platform depends on your organization's specific needs, existing infrastructure, and expertise. A platform that integrates seamlessly with your current tech stack and supports your AI/ML workflow efficiently is ideal. Here are steps to guide your selection process:

1. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborate with key stakeholders from data science, IT operations, and software architecture to define requirements and objectives.
2. **Goal Alignment**: Clearly outline your goals and the level of platform maturity necessary to achieve them within your timelines.
3. **Pilot Testing**: Run pilot projects to test the platform's fit with your business requirements and its ability to meet user expectations.

The choice is largely influenced by factors such as the organization's adoption of technologies (e.g., Kubernetes), budget constraints, and the desired balance between flexibility and managed services.

## Why is this course not tied to a specific MLOps platform?

Market vendors often emphasize the simplicity and convenience of their MLOps platforms, potentially overlooking the complexities involved in developing a solid AI/ML codebase that adheres to software engineering best practices. While each platform offers distinct advantages and experiences, the core competencies in coding for MLOps are broadly applicable, transcending platform-specific nuances.

## Is an MLOps platform required for this course?

This course is deliberately designed to be independent of any particular MLOps platform, allowing you to adapt its principles to the technological ecosystem of your choice. Whether you're integrating with specific environment management systems, utilizing different libraries, or adapting to the workflows of tools like GitLab or Azure DevOps, the course's content is flexible and can be customized to suit your organization's practices.

## How does this course prepare me for using an MLOps platform?

Despite the diversity of artifacts supported by MLOps platforms—from Jupyter notebooks to standalone scripts and Python packages—employing Python packages offers a robust and maintainable approach. This course equips you with the knowledge to effectively integrate such packages into the Python ecosystem, utilizing tools like pytest and coverage for testing, and managing packages via repositories like PyPI or Docker Hub. This foundation allows you to focus on refining other critical components of your projects, such as data and model management and orchestration, with the confidence that your codebase is well-structured and reliable.
