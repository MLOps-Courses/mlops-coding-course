# 0.1. Data

Data is often referred to as the fuel for Machine Learning, and although this course focuses on MLOps, it's crucial to have access to data to fully grasp the various concepts and technologies involved.

## Types of Data


## Data Sources



## Which data should I use?

The question of which dataset to use is common, and honestly, the best dataset is the one you're most familiar with. Despite the vast array of data types and the diverse applications they support, many MLOps concepts are applicable across different domains, allowing for a level of abstraction from specific applications.

We will look into the specificities of certain types of applications later in the course. For now, we offer two options for getting started.

### Option 1: Use your own dataset (recommended)

You are encouraged to use your own dataset for this training.

Your goal is to run the steps for yourself, it will be even better on your own data.

### Option 2: Use a dataset from Kaggle

If you don't have a dataset to experiment on, we propose to use the following dataset:

- Name: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

TODO:
- Present the datasets: size, columns, objective, ...
