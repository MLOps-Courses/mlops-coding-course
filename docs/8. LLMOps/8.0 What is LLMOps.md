# LLMOps vs. MLOps: Similarities, Differences, and Workflows


In the evolving world of machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force. These models, which excel at tasks such as answering open-ended questions, summarizing content, and executing complex instructions, are far more advanced than their traditional counterparts. However, when it comes to developing and deploying LLMs, the MLOps workflow requires significant adjustments. Let’s take a closer look at what’s common and what’s different when it comes to MLOps for LLMs.

### **Common Practices vs. Unique Challenges in MLOps for LLMs**

| **Aspect**                    | **Common Practices (MLOps)**                | **Unique Challenges for LLMs**                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Development**          | Train from scratch / fine tune, often leveraging open source models | LLMs are often fine-tuned from existing models and require specialized prompt engineering for each model family. This imposes different data curation pipelines when fine tunning a model.  |
| **Packaging ML Artifacts**     | ML artifacts often include models, datasets, and scripts | Focus shifts from models to pipelines, which include prompts, agents, or chains |
| **Evaluation**                 | Use of traditional ML metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision) | LLMs lack a single "right" answer for many use cases, requiring human feedback for evaluation (or LLM as judge) |
| **Training and Serving Infrastructure**     | Model deployment on GPUs or CPUs with scaling considerations | LLMs require large-scale GPUs, specialized hardware, and fast storage solutions which makes serving and hosting larger models expensive |

### **Understanding LLMs and Their Impact on MLOps**

LLMs represent a leap in the capabilities of machine learning, but managing these models in production requires specific attention to their unique characteristics. While the fundamental principles of MLOps remain the same, there are several aspects of LLMs that require tailored workflows and processes.

#### 1. **LLM Ecosystem: A World of Diversity**

LLMs come in many forms—proprietary models, open-source versions, and custom fine-tuned models. You may interact with models hosted via third-party APIs, integrate pre-trained open-source models, or build entirely custom models fine-tuned to your needs.

- **Implication for MLOps**: Development often begins by adapting an existing model, and over time, it evolves into custom fine-tuned models. This iterative approach means managing pipelines that are flexible and capable of integrating different model sources.

#### 2. **Inputs and Prompts: The Heart of LLM Interactions**

Unlike traditional ML models that work primarily with structured data, LLMs thrive on natural language input. This often requires developing complex prompts and text templates that help guide the model to produce the desired output.

- **Implication for MLOps**: In LLM workflows, creating and managing prompt templates becomes an essential part of the pipeline. This addition to the workflow is crucial for maximizing the model’s effectiveness.
So in some essense prompts and prompt templates work in a similar way to what features would look like in traditional ML.

#### 3. **Packaging ML Artifacts: Pipelines Over Models**

When working with LLMs, a lot of times we will be calling a model API so the ML artifact you deploy is often not the model itself, but the pipeline or workflow that drives the model's behavior. This includes not only the model but also the chains, agents, and prompt templates that help it generate meaningful responses.

- **Implication for MLOps**: Instead of focusing solely on the model, you need to consider packaging entire pipelines that can be deployed and managed in production. These pipelines include prompts, data preprocessing, and potentially post-processing logic.

#### 4. **Serving LLMs: Dynamic Infrastructure Needs**

LLMs often perform better when augmented with additional context, such as examples, related documents, or real-time data. To provide this context, you might integrate vector databases or other tools that can dynamically supply the model with relevant information.

- **Implication for MLOps**: Your infrastructure must support these dynamic requirements, with the ability to handle real-time queries and fast retrieval of relevant data. You will likely rely on high-performance GPUs and fast storage to meet these demands if you are hosting your own LLM or other serving technologies that can handle the Artifacts (chains, agents etc..) you deployed.

#### 5. **API Governance: Managing Multiple LLM APIs**

Many LLMs are accessed via third-party APIs, whether proprietary or open-source. This allows you to use powerful models without needing to host them yourself. However, managing these external dependencies requires careful oversight. And Involve different governance and cost tracking mechanisms.

- **Implication for MLOps**: Centralized API governance becomes crucial, most organizations use models from different providers, having a centralized place of governance allows us to now only manage and switch between different API providers seamlessly, ensuring the right model is always available for your needs but also to track and manage expenses across different teams/ projects within a company.

#### 6. **Size and Scale: The Massive Footprint of LLMs**

LLMs are large, often reaching hundreds of gigabytes in size. This massive scale introduces challenges in terms of model storage, loading, and serving.

- **Implication for MLOps**: Serving self hosted LLMs requires specialized hardware, such as GPUs, and efficient storage systems. Moreover, given the size of these models, optimizing for cost and performance becomes essential. However since we can often leverage paid APIs to do this hosting for us we can also focus on the serving the pipelines/business logic which requires lower compute.

#### 7. **Evaluation: A Shift Toward Human Feedback**

Unlike traditional ML models that can be evaluated using clear, quantifiable metrics, LLMs require a different approach. Because LLMs often generate outputs without a single "correct" answer, evaluation relies heavily on human feedback. For this reason it's really important that we monitor and track our LLMs responses when deploying them.

- **Implication for MLOps**: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in assessing and fine-tuning LLMs. Integrating user feedback into your evaluation and testing processes is essential for continuous improvement and ensuring high-quality model outputs.

### **The Core Principles of MLOps: What Stays the Same**

Despite these new challenges, many of the foundational principles of MLOps remain unchanged. Whether you’re working with traditional ML models or LLMs, these best practices will still apply:


| Aspect                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Environments**           | Development, staging, and production environments remain essential.        |
| **Version Control**        | Use Git to track changes in code, prompts, and configurations.             |
| **Model Lifecycle**        | Manage model development with tools like MLflow and lifecycle registries.  |
| **Data Storage**           | Store data using lakehouse architectures and Delta tables for scalability. |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**        | Existing CI/CD infrastructure integrates with LLM workflows.               |

The modular structure of MLOps also persists:
- Pipelines for featurization, training, and inference remain integral.
- Monitoring, testing, and governance practices apply universally.
