# 6.1. License

## What is a software license?

A software license is a legal framework that defines how others may use, modify, distribute, and contribute to your project. It sets the boundaries and rules for engagement, ensuring clarity and protecting both the creators and users of the software.

## Why do I need a software license?

A software license is crucial for several reasons:
- **Legal Clarity**: Ensures your project is used under the conditions you've stipulated.
- **Copyright Protection**: Particularly vital for companies, it safeguards intellectual property rights.
- **Open Source Integrity**: For open-source projects, it outlines what is permissible, preserving the ethos of open collaboration.

### Example: MIT vs GPLv3

The MIT and GPLv3 licenses represent different philosophies in open-source licensing. MIT is permissive, allowing broad freedom, including commercial use, while GPLv3 mandates that derivative works also be open source, thus preserving the open nature of the software.

### Case Study: ElasticSearch vs OpenSearch

The ElasticSearch vs OpenSearch scenario exemplifies the impact of license choices. ElasticSearch shifted from Apache 2.0 to a dual-license model, sparking the creation of OpenSearch by AWS under the more permissive Apache 2.0. This highlights how license changes can influence the software ecosystem.
