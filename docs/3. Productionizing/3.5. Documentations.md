# 3.5. Documentations

## What are software documentations?

[Software documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation) encompasses written text or illustrations that support a software project. It can range from comprehensive API documentation to high-level overviews, guides, and tutorials. Effective documentation plays a crucial role in assisting users and contributors by explaining how to utilize and contribute to a project, ensuring the software is accessible and maintainable.

## Why do you need to create documentations?

Documentation is pivotal for several reasons:

- **Usability**: It aids users in understanding how to interact with your software, detailing accepted inputs and expected outputs.
- **Maintainability**: Documentation facilitates new contributors in navigating the codebase and contributing efficiently, such as guiding through the process of submitting a pull request.
- **Longevity**: Projects with thorough documentation are more likely to be adopted, maintained, and enhanced over time, thanks to resources like troubleshooting sections.
- **Quality Assurance**: The process of writing documentation can uncover design issues or bugs, much like explaining a problem aloud can lead to solutions (e.g., through a data glossary).

High-quality documentation encourages the use of your software and is valued by your users, while poor documentation can hinder developer productivity and deter users from engaging with your solution.

## How should you associate documentations to your code base?

Documentation within Python code can be incorporated in three key places:

- **[Module documentation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)**: This should be placed at the top of your Python module to provide an overview.

```python
"""Define trainable machine learning models."""
```

- **[Function or method documentation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)**: Use this to describe the purpose of functions or methods, their parameters, and return values.

```python
def parse_file(path: str) -> Config:
    """Parse a config file from a given path.

    Args:
        path (str): Path to the local config file.

    Returns:
        Config: Parsed representation of the config file.
    """
    return oc.OmegaConf.load(path)
```

- **[Class documentation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)**: Here, you describe the purpose and parameters of a class.

```python
class ParquetReader(Reader):
    """Reads a dataframe from a parquet file.

    Attributes:
        path (str): The local path to the dataset.
    """

    path: str
```

Beyond in-code documentation, complementing it with external documentation (e.g., project organization guides or how to report a bug) is beneficial.

## Which tool, format, and convention should you use to create documentations?

For creating documentation, you have multiple tools, formats, and conventions at your disposal:

- **Tools**:
    - **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**: A fast, simple static site generator designed for project documentation, built with Python.
    - **[pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/)**: A tool and library for auto-generating API documentation for Python projects, best for API docs.
    - **[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)**: A robust tool for creating detailed and beautiful documentation, popular within the Python community, albeit with a steeper setup curve.

- **Formats**:
    - **[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)**: A straightforward text format that converts to HTML, ideal for simpler docs.
    - **[reStructuredText (reST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html)**: Offers more features than Markdown, widely used in Python documentation, especially with Sphinx.

- **Convention**:
    - **[Numpy Style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)**: Features a clear, structured format for documenting Python functions, classes, and modules, focusing on readability.
    - **[Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)**: Known for its simplicity and ease of use in documenting Python code, emphasizing clarity and brevity.
    - **[reStructuredText](https://developer.lsst.io/restructuredtext/style.html)**: Offers a comprehensive set of markup syntax and constructs, ideal for technical documentation that requires detailed structuring and cross-referencing.

For best practices, choose a tool and format that align with your project's needs and complexity. Adopting a widely recognized convention can facilitate consistency and comprehension across your documentation. Generating a simple API documentation can be as simple as calling a tool like [`pdoc`](https://pdoc.dev/) with an input and output directory:

```bash
$ poetry run pdoc --docformat=google --output-directory=docs/ src/bikes
```

You can also use your IDE or some extensions like [autoDocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) to automate the documentation generation process.

## Is there some frameworks for organizing good documentation?

[Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) is a framework that offers a systematic approach to crafting technical documentation, recognizing four distinct documentation needs: tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and explanations. It suggests organizing documentation to align with these needs, ensuring users find the information they're looking for efficiently.

## What are best practices for writing your project documentation?

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Strive for clear, straightforward documentation, avoiding complex language or unnecessary technical jargon.
2. **Consistent Style**: Maintain a uniform style and format throughout all documentation to enhance readability.
3. **Keep It Updated**: Regularly revise documentation to reflect the latest changes and additions to your software.
4. **Use Examples**: Provide practical examples to illustrate how different parts of your software operate.
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure your documentation is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
6. **Feedback Loop**: Encourage and incorporate feedback on your documentation to continuously improve its quality.
7. **Multilingual Support**: If possible, offer documentation in multiple languages to cater to a wider audience.
8. **Searchable**: Implement search functionality to allow users to quickly locate relevant information within your documentation.
9. **Versioning**: If your software has multiple versions, provide corresponding documentation for each version.
