# 3.2. Paradigms

## What is a programming paradigm?

[A programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) refers to a style or methodology of programming that provides a framework for structuring and solving problems. Paradigms influence how we organize, write, and think about code. Common programming paradigms include [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), and [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) programming. Each paradigm offers a unique approach to code organization, abstraction, and reuse.

- **[Procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)** emphasizes a step-by-step set of instructions, focusing on routines or subroutines to process data.
- **[Object-oriented programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)** encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data within objects, promoting modularity and reuse.
- **[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)** treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding changing state and mutable data.
- **[Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)** specifies what the program should accomplish rather than explicitly listing commands or steps to achieve it.

## Can you provide code examples for MLOps with each paradigm?

### [Procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)

[Procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) is a common method for structuring AI/ML code bases. This approach involves writing the entire program as a sequence of steps in a single script. This paradigm can be straightforward and easy to understand, making it appealing for simple projects. However, this simplicity might not be suitable for more complex real-world applications. Here is an illustrative example:

```python
# Simplistic AI/ML Python Script Example

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
data.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Split data
X, y = data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) in AI/ML projects promotes modular and declarative coding styles by encapsulating code in functions. This method enhances code clarity and maintainability by allowing functions to be reused and tested separately. High-order functions, immutability, and pure functions are key features of this paradigm. An example using functional programming is as follows:

```python
from typing import Callable, Tuple

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def load_and_preprocess_data(filepath: str, fill_na_value: float, target_name: str) -> Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series]:
    """Load and preprocess data."""
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    data = data.fillna(fill_na_value)
    X = data.drop(target_name, axis=1)
    y = data[target_name]
    return X, y

def split_data(X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series, test_size: float, random_state: int) -> Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame, pd.Series, pd.Series]:
    """Split the data into a train and testing sets."""
    return train_test_split(X, y, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state)

def train_model(X_train: pd.DataFrame, y_train: pd.Series, model_func: Callable[[], BaseEstimator], **kwargs) -> BaseEstimator:
    """Train the model with inputs and target data."""
    model = model_func(**kwargs)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

def evaluate_model(model: BaseEstimator, X_test: pd.DataFrame, y_test: pd.Series) -> float:
    """Evaluate the model with a single metric."""
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
    return accuracy

def get_model(model_name: str) -> Callable[[], BaseEstimator]:
    """High-order function to select the model to train."""
    if model_name == "logistic_regression":
        return LogisticRegression
    elif model_name == "random_forest":
        return RandomForestClassifier
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Model {model_name} is not supported.")

def run_workflow(model_name: str, model_kwargs: dict, filepath: str, fill_na_value: float, target_name: str, test_size: float, random_state: int) -> None:
    """Orchestrate the training workflow."""
    X, y = load_and_preprocess_data(filepath, fill_na_value, target_name)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(X, y, test_size, random_state)
    model_func = get_model(model_name)
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train, model_func, **model_kwargs)
    evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)

# Example usage
run_workflow(
    filepath='dataset.csv',
    fill_na_value=0.0,
    target_name='target',
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42,
    model_name='random_forest',  # Or 'logistic_regression'
    model_kwargs={'n_estimators': 30},
)
```

### [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

[Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) uses classes and objects to organize code, making it easier to manage large applications. It fully supports the encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism concepts, making it ideal for complex systems. Python's compatibility with OOP is evidenced by many frameworks and libraries adopting it. Below is an example of using OOP principles to manage models:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Tuple, Type

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

class Model(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for models."""
    @abstractmethod
    def train(self, X_train: pd.DataFrame, y_train: pd.Series) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def predict(self, X: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
        pass

class RandomForestModel(Model):
    """Random Forest Classifier model."""
    def __init__(self, n_estimators: int = 20, max_depth: int = 5) -> None:
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators, max_depth=max_depth)

    def train(self, X_train: pd.DataFrame, y_train: pd.Series) -> None:
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    def predict(self, X: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
        return self.model.predict(X)

class KerasBinaryClassifier(Model):
    """Simple binary classification model using Keras."""
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, epochs: int = 100, batch_size: int = 32) -> None:
        self.epochs = epochs
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.model = Sequential([
            Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
            Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
        self.model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    def train(self, X_train: pd.DataFrame, y_train: pd.Series) -> None:
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=self.epochs, batch_size=self.batch_size)

    def predict(self, X: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
        predictions = self.model.predict(X)
        return (predictions > 0.5).flatten()

class ModelFactory:
    """Factory to create model instances."""
    @staticmethod
    def get_model(model_name: str, **kwargs) -> Model:
        # Assume all model classes are defined in the global scope.
        model_class = globals()[model_name]
        return model_class(**kwargs)

class Workflow:
    """Main workflow class for model training and evaluation."""
    def run_workflow(self, model_name: str, model_kwargs: dict, filepath: str, fill_na_value: float, target_name: str, test_size: float, random_state: int) -> None:
        X, y = self.load_and_preprocess_data(filepath, fill_na_value, target_name)
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = self.split_data(X, y, test_size, random_state)
        model = ModelFactory.get_model(model_name, **model_kwargs)
        model.train(X_train, y_train)
        accuracy = self.evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
        print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

    def load_and_preprocess_data(self, filepath: str, fill_na_value: float, target_name: str) -> Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.Series]:
        """Load and preprocess data."""
        data = pd.read_csv(filepath)
        data = data.fillna(fill_na_value)
        X = data.drop(target_name, axis=1)
        y = data[target_name]
        return X, y

    def split_data(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series, test_size: float, random_state: int) -> Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame, pd.Series, pd.Series]:
        """Split the data into a train and testing sets."""
        return train_test_split(X, y, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state)

    def evaluate_model(self, model: Model, X_test: pd.DataFrame, y_test: pd.Series) -> float:
        """Evaluate the model with a single metric."""
        predictions = model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
        return accuracy

# Example usage
workflow = Workflow()
workflow.run_workflow(
    filepath='dataset.csv',
    fill_na_value=0.0,
    target_name='target',
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state="42",
    model_name='RandomForestModel',  # Or 'KerasBinaryClassifier'
    model_kwargs={'n_estimators': 30},
)
```

### [Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)

[Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) is a style where you specify what the program should accomplish without explicitly listing commands or steps to achieve it. This approach can greatly simplify coding in complex systems by separating the logic of what needs to be done from the implementation details. A common use case in machine learning is configuring models and training pipelines using high-level configuration files, which are then processed by machine learning frameworks that handle the underlying operations.

For example, using [Ludwig](https://ludwig.ai/latest/examples/mnist/), a tool for training machine learning models with declarative configurations, you can specify the architecture and training parameters of a model in YAML format. This allows you to train a model without writing the detailed procedural code typically required. Here's an example of how to train a model to classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) defined in a

```yaml
# config.yaml
input_features:
- name: image_path
  type: image
  encoder:
      type: stacked_cnn
      conv_layers:
        - num_filters: 32
          filter_size: 3
          pool_size: 2
          pool_stride: 2
        - num_filters: 64
          filter_size: 3
          pool_size: 2
          pool_stride: 2
          dropout: 0.4
      fc_layers:
        - output_size: 128
          dropout: 0.4

output_features:
 - name: label
   type: category

trainer:
  epochs: 5
```

To train the model using this configuration, you would run the following command:

```bash
ludwig train --dataset mnist_dataset.csv --config config.yaml
```

## Why do you need to use functions and objects?

Functions and objects play a crucial role in structuring code in a readable, maintainable, and reusable manner. They allow you to encapsulate functionality and state, making complex software systems more manageable.

Functions enable you to define a block of code that performs a single action, which can be executed whenever the function is called. This promotes code reuse and simplifies debugging and testing by isolating functionality.

Objects, fundamental to the object-oriented programming paradigm, bundle data and the methods that operate on that data. This encapsulation promotes modularity, as objects can be developed independently and used in different contexts.

## How should you write a new function or object?

When identifying opportunities to encapsulate code into functions or objects, look for repetitive code patterns, complex logic that needs isolation, or concepts that can be modeled as real-world objects.

In the case of repetitive data loading tasks, abstracting the logic into a function simplifies the process:

```python
def load_dataset(path: str, index_col: str = "Id") -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load a CSV dataset from a local path."""
    dataset = pd.read_csv(path, index_col=index_col)
    print(dataset.shape)
    return dataset
```

When it comes to objects, encapsulate data and behavior that logically belong together. For instance, a `DataPreprocessor` class could encapsulate methods for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data, keeping these operations neatly packaged and reusable.

## How should you organize all your functions and objects?

Structuring functions and objects into modules helps maintain a clean and navigable codebase. This structure should evolve naturally, starting from a simple layout and growing in complexity as the project expands. For example:

- `data.py` for data loading, processing functions, and classes.
- `utils.py` for utility functions and classes that support various parts of the project.
- `models.py` for classes representing machine learning models and their logic.

This modular approach aids in separation of concerns, making your code more organized and manageable.

## Which coding paradigm do you recommend for MLOps code bases?

When developing MLOps applications, selecting the appropriate coding paradigm is crucial for scalability and robustness. While Python supports various programming styles, it is particularly well-suited for object-oriented programming (OOP). This paradigm is advantageous for large applications, as it effectively handles [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) through both [nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system) and [structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system) typing. A testament of Python's OOP capabilities can be shown in popular projects such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), and [Keras](https://keras.io/).

Although Python can utilize functional programming (FP) features, such as functions and [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function), it does not fully embrace the functional paradigm. It lacks critical FP features including [ad-hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism) or [parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism) polymorphism, [tail-call](https://wiki.c2.com/?TailCallOptimization=) optimization, and [efficient immutable data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure). These shortcomings make Python less ideal for pure functional programming compared to languages specifically designed for FP like Haskell or Clojure.

Given these considerations, we recommend favoring the object-oriented paradigm when building MLOps applications in Python. However, Python's flexibility allows for the integration of functional programming elements to enhance code quality and maintainability.

## What is the hybrid style that mixes object-oriented and functional programming?

The [hybrid programming style in Python](https://mlops.community/finding-harmony-in-mlops-balancing-functional-and-object-oriented-approaches-%E2%98%AF/) blends the best features of object-oriented and functional programming to create robust and maintainable MLOps applications. This approach helps overcome some of Python's limitations in functional programming while leveraging its strong OOP capabilities. Here are key principles to follow when implementing a hybrid style:

1. **Immutable Attributes**: Design objects with immutable attributes to prevent changes to the object's state after initialization. This approach minimizes side effects and enhances predictability.
2. **Output-Oriented Methods**: Methods should primarily return outputs instead of modifying internal state. This practice encourages the separation of concerns and facilitates easier testing and debugging.
3. **Idempotent Methods**: Ensure methods are idempotent, meaning they consistently return the same result for the same inputs, a core principle in functional programming.
4. **Centralized Imperative Statements**: Use high-level classes to manage imperative operations (e.g., logging, database updates). This centralization helps delineate where side effects occur within the application, similar to how the IO monad operates in Haskell.
5. **Leverage OOP Benefits**: Continue to utilize object-oriented features such as subtyping polymorphism and intuitive class-based representations for better program extensibility and readability.

By integrating these principles, developers can create a flexible architecture that supports extensibility and robustness, which are essential for effective MLOps applications. The hybrid style enables the combination of OOP's clarity and structural benefits with FP's emphasis on immutability and state management, resulting in cleaner, more manageable code.

## What are the best practices for creating functions and objects?

Following best practices ensures that your functions and objects are reliable, maintainable, and easy to understand:

1. **[Type Hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)**: Specify input and output types to improve code readability and tooling support.
2. **[Docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)**: Describe the purpose and usage of functions and objects, including parameters and return values.
3. **[Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)**: Aim for each function and object to perform a single task or represent a single concept.
4. **Descriptive Names**: Choose names that clearly convey the purpose and functionality.
5. **Default Arguments**: Use default arguments to provide flexibility, with caution around mutable defaults.
6. **Error Handling**: Incorporate error handling and validations to make your code robust.
7. **Limit Parameters**: Keep the number of parameters to a minimum for simplicity and ease of use.
8. **Avoid Global Variables**: Use local variables within functions and objects to avoid unintended side effects.
9. **Testing**: Regularly test your code to catch and fix errors early.
10. **Readability**: Prioritize clear and straightforward code, making it accessible to others (and your future self).
