# 3.1. Modules

## What are Python modules?

[Python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) are essentially files containing Python code, which serve as a fundamental organizational unit in Python programming. These files encapsulate definitions and implementations that can be reused and shared across different parts of your program.

Modules in Python are not just physical files on disk; they represent a namespace where various Python objects like functions, classes, variables, and constants reside. When you import a module, you're bringing these objects into your current script or notebook.

To identify the physical location of a module, you can use its `__file__` attribute:

```python
import math
print(math.__file__)
```

## Why do I need Python modules?

Modules in Python are vital for maintaining a clean and manageable codebase, especially in larger projects. They allow you to logically separate your code into distinct sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of your application.

For instance, in a machine learning project, you might have separate modules for handling AI models (`models.py`), another for dataset manipulation (`datasets.py`), and so on. This modular approach enhances readability, maintainability, and scalability of your code.

While small projects (under 100 lines of code) might not necessitate multiple modules, for larger and more complex projects, adopting a modular structure is highly recommended.

## How should I create a Python module?

Creating a Python module is straightforward. Essentially, a module is a `.py` file within a Python package. Here's how you can create modules in a hypothetical project located at `src/price-house/`:

```bash
$ touch src/price-house/models.py
$ touch src/price-house/datasets.py
```

These commands create two modules: `models.py` and `datasets.py`, each potentially serving different purposes in your application.

## How should I import my Python module?

Python's module importing mechanism is akin to [Unix systems' path resolution](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux). When you import a module, Python searches through a list of directories specified in `sys.path` and imports the first match it finds.

You can view the current Python paths by inspecting the `sys.path` variable:

```python
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

If you've installed your package locally using `poetry install`, it should appear in `sys.path`, making your modules readily importable.

## How should I organize my Python modules?

Organizing Python modules can be approached in several ways. You might find inspiration by looking at the structure of open-source packages. Here are some strategies:

1. **Conceptual Segregation**: Create a module for each major concept or component in your application, using nouns rather than verbs for naming. Examples include:
   - `models.py`
   - `jobs.py`
   - `datasets.py`
   - `services.py`
   - `splitters.py`

2. **IO and Domain Separation**: Inspired by [IO monad in Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_IO) and [Domain-Driven Design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2009/february/best-practice-an-introduction-to-domain-driven-design), this approach differentiates between modules interacting with the external world (I/O) and those handling internal logic (domain). For instance:
   - **IO Layer**:
     - `io/services.py`
     - `io/datasets.py`
   - **Domain Layer**:
     - `domains/models.py`
     - `domains/splitters.py`
   - **High-Level Tasks**:
     - `training.py`
     - `tuning.py`
     - `inference.py`

This structure acknowledges that I/O operations are inherently risky and unpredictable, whereas domain logic is more controlled and predictable. High-level tasks then bind these two layers together.

## What are the risks of using Python modules?

One significant risk associated with Python modules is the possibility of [side-effects](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46024552/how-to-package-a-library-whose-import-produces-side-effects-in-python) occurring during import. This means that merely importing a module can trigger code execution, which, while sometimes useful (e.g., setting up a global context in MLflow), can also lead to unintended consequences and bugs.

To mitigate this, it's best to confine side-effects to specific entry points (like scripts defined in your project's `pyproject.toml` file under `scripts`). Modules should ideally contain only definitions (functions, classes, etc.) and be free from side-effect-inducing code at import time.
