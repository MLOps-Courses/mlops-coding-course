## What is a function?

In programming, a function is a block of organized, reusable code designed to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

Here's an example of a function in Python that loads a dataset from a given file path and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
def load_dataset(path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load a CSV dataset from a local path."""
    return pd.read_csv(path)
```

This example not only shows a function definition but also illustrates the use of [type hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) (`str`, `pd.DataFrame`) and a [docstring](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for documentation.

## Why do I need to use functions?

Functions are fundamental in writing clean, readable, and efficient code. They allow you to abstract away complex implementation details and reuse code across different parts of your project. This not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors, as each function can be tested and debugged independently.

Developing a sense for when to encapsulate code in a function is a skill that improves with experience. It involves striking a balance between keeping your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and not overcomplicating simple tasks.

## How should I write a new function?

When you notice repetitive patterns or commonalities in your code, it's often a good opportunity to abstract that code into a function. Take the following example:

```python
# cell 1
train = pd.read_csv(TRAIN_DATA_PATH, index_col='Id')
print(train.shape)
train.head()

# cell 2
test = pd.read_csv(TEST_DATA_PATH, index_col='Id')
print(test.shape)
test.head()
```

This can be refactored into a function:

```python
def load_dataset(path: str, index_col: str = "Id") -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load a CSV dataset from a local path."""
    dataset = pd.read_csv(path, index_col=index_col)
    print(dataset.shape)
    return dataset

# cell 1
train = load_dataset(TRAIN_DATA_PATH)

# cell 2
test = load_dataset(TEST_DATA_PATH)
```

This approach offers several benefits:
1. Reduces code duplication.
2. Encapsulates specific details (like `index_col`).
3. Creates a project-specific language or interface (e.g., `load_dataset`).

## How should I organize all my functions?

Organizing functions into related [Python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) is a good practice for maintaining a clean and manageable codebase. Start with a simple, flat structure and evolve as needed. For instance:
- `datasets.py` for data loading and processing functions.
- `configs.py` for configuration-related functions.
- `models.py` for machine learning models and utilities.

The structure can be adapted based on the specifics of your project, and you can introduce sub-modules or folders as your codebase grows.

## What are the best practices for functions?

1. **Type hints**: Use type hints to specify input and output types.
2. **Docstring**: Include a docstring for each function, describing its purpose, parameters, and return value.
3. **Single Responsibility**: Ensure each function performs a single task. Avoid using feature flags that alter the function's core behavior.
4. **Descriptive Names**: Choose clear and descriptive names for functions and parameters.
5. **Default Arguments**: Utilize default arguments for increased flexibility. Avoid using mutable default arguments.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling and assertions for robustness.
7. **Limit Parameters**: Keep the number of parameters reasonable to maintain function usability.
8. **Avoid Global Variables**: Prefer local variables to global ones to maintain state control within functions.
9. **Testing**: Regularly write and update tests to ensure functions work as expected.
10. **Readability**: Strive for clarity and simplicity in your code to make it easily understandable.
