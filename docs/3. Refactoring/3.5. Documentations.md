# 3.5. Documentations

## What are documentations?

Documentation in the context of software development refers to written text or illustrations that accompany a software project. This can include anything from detailed API documentation to high-level overviews, guides, and tutorials. Good documentation helps users and contributors understand how to use and contribute to a project.

### Types of Documentation:

1. **API Documentation**: Detailed information about the functions, classes, return types, and arguments in your code.
2. **Developer Guides**: Instructions on how to set up and contribute to the project.
3. **User Manuals**: Guides for end-users on how to use the software.
4. **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to achieve specific tasks with the software.
5. **FAQs**: Answers to frequently asked questions.
6. **Release Notes**: Information about new features, bug fixes, and changes in new versions.

## Why do I need to create documentations?

Creating documentation is essential for several reasons:

- **Usability**: Helps users understand how to use your software.
- **Maintainability**: Makes it easier for new contributors to understand the codebase and contribute effectively.
- **Longevity**: Well-documented projects are more likely to be used, maintained, and improved over time.
- **Quality Assurance**: Writing documentation can sometimes reveal underlying design flaws or bugs, similar to how explaining a problem aloud can help you find a solution.

Testing your documentation is just as important as testing your code. Regularly review and update your documentation to ensure it remains accurate and useful.

## Which tool should I use to create documentations?

There are several tools and formats for creating documentation:

- **Tools**:
  - **MkDocs**: A fast and simple static site generator that's geared towards project documentation. Written in Python.
  - **pdoc**: A library and command-line tool to auto-generate API documentation for Python projects.
  - **Sphinx**: A tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It's widely used in the Python community.

- **Formats**:
  - **Markdown**: Easy-to-write plain text format that converts to structurally valid HTML. Suitable for simpler documentation.
  - **reStructuredText (reST)**: More feature-rich than Markdown, used extensively in the Python ecosystem, particularly with Sphinx.

## How should I associate documentations to my code base?

Associating documentation with your codebase involves:

- **In-Code Documentation**: Use comments and docstrings to document your code directly within the source files.
- **External Documentation**: Maintain a separate documentation directory (e.g., `docs/`) in your project repository. This can be generated from your code with tools like Sphinx or MkDocs.
- **Version Control**: Keep your documentation under version control alongside your code. This ensures that changes in code and corresponding documentation are tracked together.
- **Hosting**: Use platforms like ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages, or GitLab Pages to host your documentation so it's easily accessible to users.

## What are best practices for writing my project documentation?

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Write clear and concise documentation. Avoid unnecessary jargon and complex sentences.
2. **Consistent Style**: Use a consistent style and format across all your documentation.
3. **Keep It Updated**: Regularly update the documentation to reflect changes in the software.
4. **Use Examples**: Include examples to demonstrate how to use different parts of your software.
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure your documentation is accessible, including to those with disabilities.
6. **Feedback Loop**: Encourage feedback on your documentation and incorporate it to improve.
7. **Multilingual Support**: Consider providing documentation in multiple languages, if applicable.
8. **Searchable**: Make sure your documentation is easily searchable to quickly find relevant information.
9. **Versioning**: Provide documentation for multiple versions of your software if necessary.
10. **Testing Documentation**: Regularly test your documentation for accuracy, just as you would test your code.
