# 3.6. VS Code Workspace

## What are VS Code Workspaces?

[VS Code Workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) are powerful configurations that allow you to manage and work on multiple projects within Visual Studio Code efficiently. A workspace can include one or more folders that are related to a particular project or task. Workspaces in VS Code enable you to save your project's settings, debug configurations, and extensions separately from your global VS Code settings, providing a customized and consistent development environment across your team.

## Why should I use VS Code Workspace?

Using a VS Code Workspace offers several benefits:

- **Shared Settings**: Workspaces allow you to define common settings across all developers working on the project, ensuring consistency in coding conventions and reducing setup time for new contributors.
- **Productivity**: They enable developers to quickly switch contexts between different projects, each with its own tailored settings and preferences, thus enhancing productivity and focus.
- **Customization**: Workspaces provide the flexibility to customize the development environment according to the specific needs of a project without affecting global settings, making it easier to work on projects with different requirements.

## How should I create and open my VS Code Workspace?

To create and open a VS Code Workspace:

1. **Create a Workspace**: Open VS Code and go to `File` > `Save Workspace As...` to save your current folder as a workspace. Provide a name for your workspace file, which will have a `.code-workspace` extension.
2. **Add Folders**: You can add multiple project folders to your workspace by going to `File` > `Add Folder to Workspace...` This is useful for grouping related projects.
3. **Open a Workspace**: To open an existing workspace, go to `File` > `Open Workspace...` and select the `.code-workspace` file you wish to open.

## Which configurations can I pass to my workspace configuration?

VS Code Workspace configurations support [the same settings as user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) but apply only within the context of the workspace. These configurations can be specified in the `.code-workspace` file, allowing you to customize various aspects of your development environment. For example:

```json
{
	"folders": [
		{
			"path": "."
		}
	],
	"settings": {
		"editor.formatOnSave": true,
		"python.defaultInterpreterPath": ".venv/bin/python",
		"python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
		"python.testing.pytestArgs": [
			"tests"
		],
		"[python]": {
			"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
				"source.organizeImports": true
			},
			"editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
		}
	},
	"extensions": {
		"recommendations": [
			"charliermarsh.ruff",
			"dchanco.vsc-invoke",
			"ms-python.mypy-type-checker",
			"ms-python.python",
			"ms-python.vscode-pylance",
			"redhat.vscode-yaml"
		]
	}
}
```

This configuration example sets up a project with:

- **Folders**: Defines the project folders included in the workspace.
- **Settings**: Customizes editor behavior, such as format on save, default Python interpreter path, and testing configurations specific to Python.
- **Extensions**: Recommends extensions beneficial for the project, promoting consistency across the development team.

By tailoring workspace settings, you ensure that every team member has a consistent development environment, which can include specific code formatting rules, linter settings, and extensions that are automatically recommended upon opening the workspace.
