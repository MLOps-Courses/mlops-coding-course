# 3.4. Configurations

## What are configurations?

Configurations are sets of parameters or constants that are external to your program but are essential for its operation. They are not hard-coded but are passed to the program via different means such as:
- [Environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable)
- [Configuration files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file)
- [Command-Line Interface (CLI) arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Arguments)

For example, a configuration file in YAML format might look like this:

```yaml
job:
  KIND: TrainingJob
  inputs:
    KIND: ParquetDataset
    path: data/inputs.parquet
  target:
    KIND: ParquetDataset
    path: data/target.parquet
  output_model: outputs/model.joblib
```

## Why do I need to write configurations?

Configurations allow your code to be adaptable and flexible without needing to modify the source code for different environments or use cases. This approach aligns with the principle of separating code from its execution environment, thereby enhancing portability and ease of changes. It’s akin to customizing application settings without altering the application’s core codebase.

## Which file format should I use for configurations?

Common formats for configuration files include [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), [TOML](https://toml.io/en/), and [YAML](https://yaml.org/). YAML is often preferred due to its human-readable format, support for comments, and simpler syntax compared to TOML. However, be cautious with YAML files as they can contain malicious structures; always [load them safely](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation).

## How should I pass configuration files to my program?

Passing configuration files to your program is effectively done using the Command-Line Interface (CLI). For example:

```bash
$ program defaults.yaml training.yaml
```

CLI allows for easy integration of configuration files with other command options and flags, like verbose logging:

```bash
$ program defaults.yaml training.yaml --verbose
```

## Which toolkit should I use to parse and load configurations?

For parsing and loading configurations in Python, [OmegaConf](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/) is a robust choice. It supports [loading YAML](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#creating) from various sources, [deep merging](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#omegaconf-merge) of configurations, [variable interpolation](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#variable-interpolation), and setting configurations as [read-only](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#read-only-flag). Additionally, for cloud-based projects, [cloudpathlib](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/) is useful for loading configurations from cloud storage services like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## What are the best practices for writing and loading configurations?

1. **Safe Loading**: Always use `yaml.safe_load()` when loading YAML files to avoid executing arbitrary code.
2. **File Handling**: Employ context managers (the `with` statement) for file operations to ensure files are properly opened and closed.
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for file IO and YAML parsing is crucial, such as handling missing or corrupted files.
4. **Validate Schema**: Validate configuration files against a predefined schema to ensure the correct structure and types.
5. **Sensitive Data**: Never store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Use environment variables or secure storage solutions instead.
6. **Default Values**: Provide defaults for optional configuration parameters to enhance flexibility.
7. **Comments**: Use comments in your YAML files to explain the purpose and usage of various configurations.
8. **Consistent Formatting**: Keep a consistent format in your configuration files for ease of reading and maintenance.
9. **Versioning**: Version your configuration file format, especially for larger projects where changes in configurations are frequent and significant.
