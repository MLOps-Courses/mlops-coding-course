## What is a code repository?

[A code repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)) is a central location for storing and managing your project's code and files. It serves as the single source of truth for your project, enabling version control, collaboration, and automation.

A repository is identified by its host, owner, and name, as seen in its URL. For example, in `https://github.com/fmind/mlops-python-package`, the host is GitHub, the owner is the `fmind` organization, and the name is `mlops-python-package`.

Popular hosting platforms include:
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/):** The most popular platform for open-source projects and public collaboration.
- **[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/):** A strong competitor offering robust features for both public and private enterprise projects.
- **[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product):** Known for its excellent integration with other Atlassian products like Jira.
- **Cloud-Native Repositories:** Cloud providers like [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/repos), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) offer integrated repositories that connect seamlessly with their other cloud services.

## Why is a code repository essential for MLOps?

Configuring a code repository is a foundational step for any serious project. It moves your work from a local machine to a secure, centralized platform, unlocking key capabilities:

- **Version Control:** Track every change made to your codebase, allowing you to revert to previous versions and understand the history of your project.
- **Collaboration:** Provide a structured environment where multiple developers and data scientists can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts, using features like branches and pull requests.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Establish a reliable, accessible location for your code, ensuring that everyone on the team is working with the same version.
- **Automation:** Use the repository as a trigger point for CI/CD pipelines, automating testing, validation, and deployment workflows.

## What information should a repository's main page contain?

To make your project understandable and discoverable, its main page should include:

- **Name:** A concise, descriptive name that clearly identifies the project.
- **Description:** A brief summary of the project's purpose, what it does, and its key features.
- **Tags (Topics):** Keywords that categorize your project by its domain, technologies used, or purpose (e.g., `mlops`, `forecasting`, `python`, `scikit-learn`).

Adopting a consistent naming convention is crucial in a team setting. For example, a name like `forecasting-bikes-ml` clearly communicates the team (forecasting), the domain (bikes), and the technology (ML). This prevents naming collisions and clarifies project ownership and scope.

## What are the core concepts for versioning code?

[Commits, branches, and tags](https://blog.git-init.com/how-commits-branches-and-tags-interplay/) are the fundamental building blocks of version control in Git.

- **Commit:** A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It saves a set of changes to your files.
- **Branch:** A branch is an independent line of development. You create branches to work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase (`main` branch).
- **Tag:** A tag is a marker used to label a specific commit, most commonly for version releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

### How to Create a Commit

1.  **Modify your files** in your project directory.
2.  **Stage the changes** you want to include in the commit:
    ```bash
    # Stage a specific file
    git add <filename>

    # Stage all modified files in the current directory
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Review the staged changes** to ensure they are correct:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
4.  **Commit the changes** with a clear and descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication endpoint"
    ```

### How to Create a Branch

1.  **Ensure your main branch is up-to-date** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```
2.  **Create and switch to a new branch** in a single command:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
    Use a descriptive naming convention for your branch, such as `feature/user-login` or `fix/bug-in-data-processing`.

### How to Create a Tag

1.  **Find the commit hash** you want to tag by reviewing the project history:
    ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```
2.  **Create an annotated tag** (recommended for releases) for that commit:
    ```bash
    git tag -a v1.0.0 <commit-hash> -m "Release version 1.0.0"
    ```
    If you omit the commit hash, the tag will be applied to the latest commit.
3.  **Push the tag** to the remote repository to share it with others:
    ```bash
    git push origin v1.0.0
    ```

## What are best practices for writing commit messages?

Clear commit messages are vital for collaboration. They provide context for your changes and make the project history easy to navigate. A widely adopted standard is [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), which follows a simple format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

-   **Type:** `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore` (build changes, etc.).
-   **Description:** A concise summary of the change in the present tense.
-   **Body (Optional):** A more detailed explanation of the "what" and "why" of the change.
-   **Footer (Optional):** Used for referencing issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

**Example:**
```
feat: Add user profile page

- Implement the UI for the user profile page.
- Add API endpoint to fetch user data.

Fixes #42
```

## What is the best way to clone a repository?

[Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) can be done via HTTPS or SSH. **SSH is the recommended method** because it is more secure and convenient, as it doesn't require you to enter your credentials every time you interact with the remote repository.

**To set up SSH:**
1.  Generate a new SSH key pair if you don't have one:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
2.  [Add the public key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) (the file ending in `.pub`) to your account on the repository host (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). **Never share your private key.**

**Clone with SSH (Recommended):**
```bash
git clone git@hostname:owner/repository.git
```

**Clone with HTTPS:**
```bash
git clone https://hostname/owner/repository.git
```

## What is a `.gitignore` file and why is it essential?

A `.gitignore` file is a text file that tells Git which files or directories to intentionally ignore and not track. This is essential for keeping your repository clean and secure.

You should always ignore:
- **Dependencies and virtual environments:** `node_modules/`, `.venv/`
- **Secrets and credentials:** `.env`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`
- **Large data files:** `data/raw/`, `*.csv`, `*.parquet` (use Git LFS for large files if they must be versioned)
- **System and IDE files:** `.DS_Store`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`
- **Compiled code and caches:** `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`

## Can a repository's visibility be restricted?

Yes, you can set your repository's visibility to control access:

- **Public:** Visible to everyone on the internet. Ideal for open-source projects where you want to encourage community contributions.
- **Private:** Accessible only to you and the collaborators you explicitly grant access to. This is the standard choice for proprietary or sensitive projects.

## What is the difference between a fork and a branch?

- **[Branching](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches):** Creates an independent line of development **within the same repository**. It is the standard way for team members to collaborate on features and fixes. All work happens in one central place.
- **[Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo):** Creates a **new, separate copy** of a repository under your own account. This allows you to experiment freely without affecting the original project. Forking is common in open-source, where external contributors fork a project, make changes in their copy, and then submit a pull request back to the original repository.

## How can you automate tasks at the repository level?

You can automate workflows for testing, code quality checks, and deployments using CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines. These are typically defined in a file within your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`).

Key automation tools include:
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions):** A powerful, integrated CI/CD platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub. Workflows are triggered by repository events like pushes or pull requests.
- **[Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/about-webhooks):** Custom triggers that send a payload to an external service in response to repository events, allowing you to integrate with custom tools.
- **[Third-Party Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps):** The GitHub Marketplace offers a wide range of apps for CI/CD ([CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)), code quality ([SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/)), and project management ([Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)).

## How can you protect the main branch?

Protecting your `main` branch is critical for maintaining a stable and high-quality codebase. You can enforce rules that prevent direct or un-reviewed changes.

1.  In your repository settings, navigate to **Branches** and add a **branch protection rule** for `main`.
2.  Configure the following protections:
    - **Require a pull request before merging:** Disables direct pushes and forces all changes to go through a formal review process.
    - **Require approvals:** Mandates that at least one other team member must review and approve the changes.
    - **Require status checks to pass before merging:** Ensures that all automated checks (like tests, linting, and builds) succeed before a merge is allowed.
    - **Restrict who can push to matching branches:** Adds an extra layer of security by specifying which users or teams can merge changes.
