# 1.0. System

## Which system do I need for the course?

This course is designed to be compatible with various operating systems, including Linux, Chromebook, macOS, and Windows.

No specific hardware requirements are set; however, ensure your system has adequate CPU and RAM to process datasets efficiently.

## Can I complete the course on JupyterLab or Google Colab?

JupyterLab is supported as a development environment for this course, but it's worth noting that the course materials have been thoroughly tested on Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which offers a more comprehensive set of features.

While classic notebooks and Google Colab might suffice for chapter [2. Prototyping](../2. Prototyping/), other course exercises require access to a terminal and file system explorer, which these platforms do not support as seamlessly as VS Code.

## Do I need to install other software packages?

This course requires installing several core software packages, including  [Python](1.1. Python.md), [Poetry](./1.3. Poetry.md), [git](./1.4. git.md), and [VS Code](1.6. VS Code.md). Detailed instructions for each installation can be found in their respective chapters.

While Python is essential, other software packages are recommended, and alternatives are welcome based on personal preference.

## Is there specific requirements for MLOps projects?

MLOps projects vary significantly in complexity, from straightforward binary classifiers to advanced recommendation systems or transformers. Here's an overview of the complexity spectrum for AI/ML projects:

- Tabular Data Projects: These projects, utilizing tools like scikit-learn or XGBoost, can usually be executed on a local system with optional GPU support.
- Multimedia Data Projects: Projects that involve TensorFlow or PyTorch may require a single GPU to enhance processing speeds.
- Large Dataset Projects: For projects employing transformers or DeepSpeed, multiple GPUs across one or more hosts may be necessary.

We recommend starting with the simplest possible approach. For example, develop your model using sample data on your local computer, then scale up to a cloud computing service like Databricks for full deployment. Running multiple experiments in parallel on cloud instances can also accelerate your process.

## Can I use a cloud system (e.g., Cloud Workstation, GitHub Codespaces, ...)?

The course content is adaptable for execution on both local and cloud systems, such as GitHub Codespaces or Cloud Workstation.

Cloud platforms offer the advantage of a unified environment for team development and data security on your cloud provider's infrastructure. However, be mindful of the potential need for specific configurations and the limitations of free usage quotas associated with most cloud services.
