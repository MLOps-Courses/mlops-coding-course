# 1.0. System

Before we dive into the exciting world of machine learning operations, it's crucial to ensure that your system is properly set up. A well-configured environment is foundational for a smooth learning experience, enabling you to focus on the concepts rather than troubleshooting technical issues. This section will guide you through the essential prerequisites, from operating system compatibility to hardware specifications and software installations.

## üíª What system is recommended for this course?

This course is designed to be compatible with a variety of operating systems to ensure broad accessibility. Here are the recommended setups:

- **Operating Systems:**
    - **Linux**
    - **macOS**
    - **Windows** with Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2
    - **Chromebook** with a model that supports Linux applications.

## üß™ Can you use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) for this course?

While notebook environments like JupyterLab and Google Colab are excellent for experimentation and the initial stages of a project (as covered in the Prototyping chapter), this course is optimized for [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VS Code provides a more comprehensive development environment that is better suited for the later stages of the MLOps lifecycle, which involve productionizing, validating, and refining code.

Here's a quick comparison of why VS Code is recommended for the full scope of this course:

| Feature                  | VS Code                               | JupyterLab / Google Colab            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Integrated Terminal**  | ‚úÖ Yes                                | ‚ùå Limited or no direct access       |
| **File System Navigation** | ‚úÖ Yes                                | ‚ùå Limited and less intuitive        |
| **Source Control (Git)** | ‚úÖ Excellent integration              | ‚ùå Basic or external integration     |
| **Advanced Debugging**   | ‚úÖ Yes                                | ‚ùå Limited debugging capabilities    |
| **Code Refactoring**     | ‚úÖ Extensive support                  | ‚ùå Basic or no support               |
| **Full Project Lifecycle** | ‚úÖ Ideal for development to production | ‚úÖ Best for prototyping & analysis |

## üì¶ Are additional software installations required?

Yes, a few key software installations are necessary to follow along with the course. These tools form the backbone of a modern development workflow:

- **Python:** The primary programming language for all coding activities.
- **uv:** An extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, used for managing project dependencies efficiently.
- **Git:** The standard for version control, essential for tracking changes and collaborating on code.
- **VS Code:** The recommended Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for its powerful features and extensions.

Each of these tools is covered in detail in the upcoming sections of this chapter, with step-by-step installation guides.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What are the specific hardware requirements for MLOps projects?

The hardware required for MLOps projects can vary significantly based on the project's complexity and the type of data involved. Here‚Äôs a general guide:

- **Basic Projects (e.g., Tabular Data):** For models using libraries like Scikit-learn or XGBoost, a standard local machine is usually sufficient. A GPU is generally not required but can be beneficial for certain models.
- **Intermediate Projects (e.g., Multimedia Data):** When working with images or video, using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, access to at least one GPU becomes highly beneficial for faster model training.
- **Advanced Projects (e.g., Large-Scale Models):** For projects involving large models like transformers or extensive parallel processing, you may need multiple GPUs, potentially distributed across several machines.

A practical approach is to start with a local setup for initial development and then scale to cloud-based resources as needed for more intensive training and deployment. Cloud platforms also enable running multiple experiments simultaneously, which can expedite the development process.

## ü§î Why System Setup Matters for MLOps?

A well-configured system is more than just a matter of convenience; it's a cornerstone of effective MLOps. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Reproducibility:** A consistent and well-documented setup ensures that your experiments are reproducible. This means you (or your teammates) can run the same code and get the same results, which is crucial for validating models and tracking progress.
- **Scalability:** As your projects grow in complexity, your system needs to be able to scale. A proper setup allows you to transition smoothly from local development to more powerful cloud-based resources without major overhauls.
- **Collaboration:** When working in a team, a standardized development environment ensures that everyone is on the same page. This minimizes the "it works on my machine" problem and streamlines the collaboration process.
- **Efficiency:** A properly configured system with the right tools can significantly boost your productivity. From faster package management to integrated debugging, a good setup lets you focus on building and deploying models, not fighting with your tools.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Is it possible to use cloud-based systems?

This course supports both local and [cloud-based development environments](../6. Sharing/6.5. Workstations.md), including options like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Cloud Workstation](https://cloud.google.com/workstations). Cloud platforms offer considerable benefits, such as standardized development environments for easier team collaboration and enhanced security measures for your data. Nonetheless, it's crucial to understand any specific setup requirements and to manage resources effectively, especially when navigating the limitations of free tiers or usage quotas on these services.
