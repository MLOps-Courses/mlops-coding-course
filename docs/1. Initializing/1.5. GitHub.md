# 1.5. GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a renowned platform hosting millions of Git repositories, serving as a hub for software development and collaboration. It stands out as one of the world's largest communities of developers, hosting a significant portion of major open-source projects. GitHub offers a blend of source code management and social networking features tailored for developers and their projects.

## Why do I need to use GitHub?

GitHub is a versatile choice for hosting both private and open-source projects. Its widespread use makes it a familiar environment for most developers. However, alternatives exist:
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/): Offers both hosted and self-hosted options with integrated CI/CD features.
- [Cloud Source Repositories](https://cloud.google.com/source-repositories/docs): A cloud-based private Git repository service by Google Cloud.

## Which services are proposed by Github?

## How to configure GitHub for my MLOps project?

To get started:
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you haven't already.
2. Create a new repository on GitHub, choosing between public or private visibility.
3. Synchronize your local Git repository with GitHub:

```
# Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository
git remote add origin [REMOTE-URL]
# Push your commits to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## How can others collaborate on my GitHub project?

Collaboration on GitHub depends on the repository's visibility:
- **Public Repositories**: Others can [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) your project without any special permissions.
- **Private Repositories**: You need to [grant access](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github) to collaborators using their GitHub username or email.
