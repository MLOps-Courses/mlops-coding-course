## What is pyenv?

[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a powerful tool for managing multiple Python versions. It's particularly useful in a development environment where different projects may require different Python versions. Pyenv simplifies this by allowing you to switch between versions seamlessly, ensuring compatibility and consistency across your projects.

## Why should I use pyenv?

The use of pyenv offers several advantages:
- **Versatility**: Easily manage multiple Python versions for different projects.
- **Non-Root Installation**: Install new Python versions without needing root access.
- **Independence**: Frees you from reliance on the system's default Python version, reducing potential conflicts.

## How to install pyenv on my computer?

For a comprehensive installation guide, visit [Pyenv GitHub Page](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). It provides detailed instructions tailored for various operating systems.

## Which version of Python should I use for my project?

While using the latest version of Python is generally recommended, for this project, the specified version range is Python 3.12 to 4.0. Ensure compatibility within this range for optimal performance.

## How to install the version of Python required for my project?

To install a specific Python version (e.g., 3.12):
```bash
$ pyenv install 3.12
```

## How can I select the version of Python I install for my project?

To specify the Python version for your project:
1. Create a `.python-version` file in your project's root directory.
```text
# .python-version
3.12
```
2. With pyenv enabled, your environment will automatically switch to the specified version when you're in the project directory.
```bash
# Verify the Python version
$ which python
$ python --version
```

In case of issues with auto-detection, ensure that [your shell is properly configured to recognize pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv). This typically involves adding pyenv initialization to your shell configuration file.
