# 1.2. pyenv

## What is pyenv?

Pyenv is an essential tool for managing multiple Python versions on your computer. It addresses the challenge of working on multiple projects that require different versions of Python by allowing you to switch between these versions effortlessly. This capability ensures that each project has the appropriate Python environment it needs without affecting other projects or the system's default Python installation.

## Why should I use pyenv?

Using pyenv offers several key benefits:

- Flexibility: It enables you to easily manage and switch between different Python versions for various projects.
- User-Level Installation: Allows the installation of new Python versions without requiring administrative privileges.
- System Independence: Decouples your projects from the system's default Python installation, helping avoid version conflicts and dependency issues.

## How to install pyenv on my computer?

For detailed installation instructions for your specific operating system, refer to the pyenv GitHub repository. The installation guide provides step-by-step directions tailored for different platforms, ensuring a smooth setup process.

## Is there a specific setup for MLOps projects?

No. When setting up Python for MLOps projects, the main consideration is choosing the correct Python version that aligns with your project's requirements and dependencies.

## How to install the required version of Python for my project?

To install a particular Python version (e.g., Python 3.12) for your project, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ pyenv install 3.12
```

## How can I select the version of Python to install for my project?

To specify a Python version for your project, follow these steps:

1. In your project's root directory, create a .python-version file and write the desired version (e.g., 3.12) in it.
```text
3.12
```
2. Once pyenv is set up and active, your environment will automatically switch to the specified version when you navigate into the project directory.
```bash
# Confirm the active Python version
$ python --version
```
If the version doesn't switch as expected, check [your shell's configuration to ensure it's correctly set up to integrate with pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv). This typically involves adding initialization commands for pyenv to your shell's configuration file.

## How can I know the version of Python currently active in my shell?

To identify the currently active Python version in your shell, you can use:

```bash
pyenv version
```

Alternatively, without pyenv, you can determine the active Python version and its path using:

```bash
# version of python
python --version

# location of python
which python
```

This information helps you verify that the correct Python environment is activated for your project, ensuring compatibility and smooth project development.
