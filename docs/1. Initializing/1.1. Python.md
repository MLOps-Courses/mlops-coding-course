# 1.1. Python

## What is the Python language?

Python is a high-level, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language celebrated for its ease of learning and readability. It has soared in popularity among developers, consistently ranking high on various indices such as the Tiobe Index, IEEE Spectrum Annual Ranking, and RedMonk Programming Language Ranking. These rankings reflect Python's widespread adoption across many fields, from web development and automation to data science and machine learning.

Python's simplicity, combined with its powerful standard library and the vast ecosystem of third-party packages, enables developers to build applications quickly and with fewer lines of code. This makes Python an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

This course presupposes a fundamental grasp of Python, covering essential concepts like loops, conditional statements, functions, classes, and how to run Python code, as outlined in the [Overview](../0. Overview/).

## Why do most AI/ML projects use Python?

Python is the lingua franca for AI and machine learning projects, thanks to its comprehensive suite of data science libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and PyTorch and TensorFlow for deep learning. Its syntax is straightforward, facilitating quick prototyping and experimentation, which are vital in the iterative nature of machine learning projects.

Moreover, Python serves as a bridge to high-performance computing resources. It can interface with libraries written in performance-critical languages like C, C++, and Rust, allowing developers to combine ease of use with computational efficiency. While other languages may offer raw performance advantages or different paradigms, Python's unique combination of productivity, a rich data science ecosystem, and the ability to leverage existing codebases in other languages makes it unparalleled for AI/ML projects.

## Is Python a good or a bad language for MLOps?

Python's versatility and extensive tooling support make it highly effective for MLOps, balancing the ease of writing complex algorithms with the simplicity needed for maintainable code. The challenge for ML engineers lies in harnessing Python's strengths without succumbing to potential pitfalls of complexity. This course emphasizes the importance of clean code practices and the judicious use of Python's features to focus on solving domain-specific problems efficiently.

In subsequent chapters, such as [Chapter 3: Refactoring](../3. Refactoring/) and [Chapter 4: Validating](../4. Validating/), we will explore strategies to structure your Python codebase effectively and implement checks to ensure code reliability, making Python an excellent choice for MLOps.

## How easy is it to use another language for AI/ML?

Python dominates the AI/ML landscape, but it's not the only option. Languages like R, Julia, and Scala also have libraries for machine learning and statistical analysis, though their ecosystems might not be as extensive as Python's. These languages can serve as the primary language for AI/ML projects or be integrated into Python-centric workflows, providing specific advantages in performance, syntax, or domain-specific capabilities.

Adopting a language other than Python for AI/ML projects is feasible but may require additional effort to translate the principles and practices discussed in this course to the idioms and libraries of the chosen language.

## Which version of Python should I use to complete the course?

For starting new projects, the latest version of Python is recommended to benefit from the newest features and performance enhancements. However, the choice of Python version might be constrained by the compatibility requirements of essential libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, or by production environment limitations. It's generally more manageable to align development environments with production constraints than vice versa.

It's crucial to steer clear of Python versions that are no longer supported. For up-to-date information on supported Python versions, visit: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How should I install Python on my system to complete the course?

During the development phase, we suggest using `pyenv` for installing Python. This tool offers superior flexibility in managing different Python versions for individual projects, compared to system package managers or Anaconda, which tend to enforce a more rigid environment setup.

In production environments, adhering to the default Python version provided by the system is advisable to minimize compatibility issues. However, if your deployment strategy involves Docker containers, you have the freedom to choose any version of Python, thereby ensuring consistency between development and production environments.
