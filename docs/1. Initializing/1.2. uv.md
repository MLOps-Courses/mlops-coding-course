## What is uv?

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust, designed to be a drop-in replacement for `pip`, `pipx`, `venv`, and `pyenv`. Created by [Astral](https://astral.sh/), the same team behind the high-performance linter [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), `uv` aims to significantly speed up and simplify Python project management. It offers a unified toolchain that handles virtual environments, dependency resolution, package installation, and more, all while providing exceptional performance.

## Why should you use uv?

`uv` offers several compelling advantages for Python developers, especially in the context of MLOps:

- **Performance**: `uv` is incredibly fast, often outperforming `pip`, `venv`, and `pyenv` by a significant margin. This speed translates to faster project setup, quicker dependency resolution, and reduced wait times during development and deployment.
- **Unified Toolchain**: `uv` replaces multiple tools, simplifying your development workflow. It can manage virtual environments, install packages, and resolve dependencies, all within a single command-line interface.
- **Drop-in Replacement**: `uv` is designed to be a drop-in replacement for common Python tools. This means you can often substitute `uv` commands for `pip`, `venv`, or `pipx` commands without altering your existing workflows significantly.
- **Active Development**: Backed by Astral, `uv` is under active development with a focus on performance, reliability, and ease of use.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: `uv` works seamlessly across Linux, macOS, and Windows, ensuring a consistent experience regardless of your operating system.
- **Caching**: `uv` implements aggressive caching mechanisms to avoid redundant work, further speeding up operations like package installation and environment setup.

## How to install uv?

[Installing `uv` is straightforward](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). The recommended method is to use the official installation script, which automatically detects your operating system and installs the appropriate version:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can install `uv` using `pip` or `pipx`:

```bash
pip install uv
# or
pipx install uv
```

Once installed, verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
uv --version
```

## How to use uv as a drop-in replacement for pip?

`uv` can be used as a direct replacement for many common `pip` commands. Here's how:

- **Installing packages**:

```bash
uv pip install requests numpy pandas
```

- **Uninstalling packages**:

```bash
uv pip uninstall requests
```

- **Listing installed packages**:

```bash
uv pip freeze
```

- **Updating packages**:

```bash
uv pip install --upgrade requests
```

- **Installing packages from a `requirements.txt` file**:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use uv as a drop-in replacement for venv?

`uv` can also replace `venv` for creating and managing virtual environments:

- **Creating a virtual environment**:

```bash
uv venv
```

This command creates a new virtual environment in the `.venv` directory by default. You can customize the location using the `--python` flag to specify a Python interpreter path.

- **Activating the virtual environment**:

The activation process depends on your shell. For example, on bash:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- **Listing available Python interpreters**:

```bash
uv venv --python
```

## How to use uv as a drop-in replacement for pipx?

`uv` can also replace `pipx` for installing and managing globally available Python tools:

- **Installing a tool globally**:

```bash
uv tool install ruff
```

- **Listing globally installed tools**:

```bash
uv tool list
```

- **Running a tool without installing it**:

```bash
uv tool run ruff --version
```

## How to install a Python version with uv?

`uv` can also be used to install specific Python versions, similar to `pyenv`. This is particularly useful when you need to test your code against different Python environments or when a project requires a specific Python version that is not your system's default.

- **Installing a specific Python version**:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
```

This command downloads and installs Python 3.12. You can then use this version to create virtual environments or run scripts.

- **Listing available Python versions**:

```bash
uv python list
```

- **Listing installed Python versions**:

```bash
uv python list --only-installed
```

- **Removing a specific Python version**:

```bash
uv python remove 3.12
```
