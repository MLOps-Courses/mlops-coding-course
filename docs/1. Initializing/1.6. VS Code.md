## What is VS Code?

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is widely regarded for its performance, extensibility, and supportive ecosystem. VS Code supports development in multiple languages and comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. It is highly customizable, allowing users to enhance its functionality through extensions to support a vast array of programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

## Why should I use VS Code?

VS Code is an excellent choice for developers for several reasons:

- **Lightweight Performance**: Despite its small footprint, VS Code offers powerful features such as intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), code navigation, and real-time syntax highlighting.
- **Extensibility**: A vast marketplace of extensions enables support for nearly every major programming language, framework, and tool.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Execute shell commands, Git operations, and scripts directly within the editor.
- **Debugging**: Built-in debugging tools for Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript, with the ability to extend to other languages.
- **Source Control Integration**: Native Git commands and extensions for other version control systems simplify code commits, branch management, and repository synchronization.
