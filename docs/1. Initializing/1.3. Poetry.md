# 1.3. Poetry

## What is poetry?

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is an innovative package manager for Python, streamlining dependency management and package distribution. It simplifies defining project dependencies and building packages, making it a cornerstone tool for Python project management.

## What is a Python package?

A Python package is essentially a distributable archive (typically a zip file or Wheel) that encapsulates your project's source code along with essential metadata. Modern Python packages commonly use the [Wheel format](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/), an improvement over the older Egg format, for efficiency and simplicity. Curious minds can explore the contents of these packages by unzipping them.

## Why should I use poetry in my project?

Poetry brings several advantages to your project:
- **Simplified Environment Management**: It streamlines handling different Python environments.
- **Package Building and Distribution**: Easily build and share your Python packages with others.
- **Project Metadata Definition**: Define essential metadata like authors, URLs, and more in a structured format.

## How can I use poetry for my MLOps project?

To get started with Poetry:
- Create a project directory and navigate into it.
- Run `poetry init` in the terminal.
- Follow the interactive prompts to set up:
  - Package name, version, and description
  - Author details
  - Licensing information
  - Compatible Python versions
  - Opt out of defining dependencies interactively
  - Confirm to generate the configuration

You'll find a `pyproject.toml` file in your project directory, serving as the configuration centerpiece.

## How can I make my poetry project easier to manage?

To optimize Poetry management, create a `poetry.toml` configuration file at your project's root:

```toml
# Poetry configuration file - https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/

[virtualenvs]
# Use a local .venv directory for dependencies
in-project = true
# Opt for the Python version managed by pyenv
prefer-active-python = true
```

## How can I install dependencies for my project with poetry?

Poetry distinguishes between main and development dependencies:
- *Main dependencies* are essential for running your application.
- *Development dependencies* are used during development and testing.

Install main dependencies with:
```bash
$ poetry add pandas scikit-learn
```

For development dependencies, use:
```bash
$ poetry add -G dev ipykernel
```

Poetry will install these in the `.venv` directory and update your `pyproject.toml` accordingly:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
pandas = "^2.1.3"
scikit-learn = "^1.3.2"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
ipykernel = "^6.26.0"
```

## What is this weird caret symbol (^) in front of my dependencies?

The caret symbol (`^`) in Poetry is about version compatibility:
- It ensures installation of versions compatible with your application.
- It aligns with the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/), where version numbers follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

Caret requirements in Poetry allow updates without breaking compatibility. Here's how it maps:

| REQUIREMENT | VERSIONS ALLOWED |
|-------------|------------------|
| ^1.2.3      | >=1.2.3 <2.0.0   |
| ^1.2        | >=1.2.0 <2.0.0   |
| ^1          | >=1.0.0 <2.0.0   |
| ^0.2.3      | >=0.2.3 <0.3.0   |
| ^0.0.3      | >=0.0.3 <0.0.4   |
| ^0.0        | >=0.0.0 <0.1.0   |
| ^0          | >=0.0.0 <1.0.0   |

This system protects your project from inadvertently upgrading to incompatible versions. For more details, check [Poetry's dependency specification documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/).
