## What is git?

Git is a widely-used source code management system. It offers a robust suite of features for software development, including:
- **Code Versioning**: Tracks changes in source code over time.
- **Branch Management**: Facilitates parallel development through branches.
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Supports collaborative development processes.

## Why do I need git?

Incorporating Git into your workflow offers numerous advantages:
- **Change Tracking**: Easily track and understand code changes.
- **Branching and Merging**: Manage multiple versions of code simultaneously, merging changes as needed.
- **Collaboration Efficiency**: Safely collaborate on a shared codebase, reducing the risk of overwriting others' work.

## How should I use git for my project?

If you're new to Git, start with [GitHub's Git Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git). Git structures code changes in units called commits. For beginners, here's how to start:

```
# Initialize git in your project directory
git init
# Stage files for the first commit
git add README.md LICENSE.txt
# Check the staging status
git status
# Commit your changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```

## Should I commit every file in my project?

Not every file is suitable for Git tracking. Examples of files to exclude:
- **Secrets**: Avoid committing sensitive information like keys.
- **Large Files**: Use [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) for files larger than 100MB.
- **Cache Files**: Exclude environment-specific files, like virtual environments or logs.

Create a `.gitignore` file to specify what Git should ignore:

```
# Example .gitignore content

# Environment folders
/.venv/
poetry.lock

# Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Python cache
*.py[cod]
__pycache__/
```

Each line in `.gitignore` specifies a file, folder, or pattern for Git to exclude.
