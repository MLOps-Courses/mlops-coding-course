# üåø 1.4. Git

## ü§î What is Git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is
integral for managing both small and large projects effectively. It excels in
tracking source code changes during software development, enabling multiple
developers to collaborate on the same project without conflicts. Git is highly
regarded for its robust data integrity, versatility, and support for complex,
nonlinear development workflows.

## üéØ Why is Git Essential?

Git serves several critical purposes in software development:

- **Version Control**: It meticulously tracks and manages changes to your
  project, offering the ability to revert to previous states, compare changes
  across timelines, and more.
- **Collaboration**: Git facilitates simultaneous collaboration among multiple
  contributors on the same project. It supports branching and merging
  strategies, allowing seamless teamwork without risking data overwrite.
- **Backup and Restore**: With changes stored in a repository, Git acts as a
  backup mechanism. You can revert your project to a prior state or retrieve
  lost data as needed.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git enables you to create branches for experimenting
  or developing new features independently of the main project, which can later
  be merged back into the mainline without disrupting the ongoing development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Installation

To install Git, consult the
[Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git),
which offers comprehensive instructions for a variety of operating systems.

```bash
# Installation on macOS with Homebrew
brew install git

# Installation on Debian/Ubuntu with APT
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### Initial Configuration

Before you start using Git, you need to configure it with your name and email
address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

You can verify your configuration with:

```bash
git config --list
```

## üöÄ The Git Workflow: A Practical Guide

Understanding the basic Git workflow is key to using it effectively. It consists
of three main states:

1. **Working Directory**: This is your local project folder with all its files.
2. **Staging Area (Index)**: This is an intermediate area where you can build up
   your next commit. It allows you to choose which changes you want to include.
3. **Repository (`.git` directory)**: This is where Git stores the project's
   history and metadata. A commit takes the files from the staging area and
   stores that snapshot permanently to your repository.

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to a common workflow:

1. **Initialize a Repository**: In your project directory, run this command to
   create a new local Git repository.

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. **Check the Status**: Use `git status` to see the state of your working
   directory and staging area. It shows which files are new, modified, or
   staged.

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

3. **Stage Files**: Add files to the staging area to prepare them for a commit.
   You can add one file or all of them.

    ```bash
    # Stage a specific file
    git add README.md

    # Stage all new and modified files
    git add .
    ```

4. **Commit Changes**: Commit the staged files to your repository. The commit
   message should be a short, descriptive summary of the changes.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add initial project files"
    ```

5. **View History**: Use `git log` to see the history of commits in your
   repository.

    ```bash
    git log
    ```

## üåø Branching: Working in Parallel

Branches allow you to work on different features or experiments without affecting
the main codebase (often called the `main` or `master` branch).

- **Create a new branch and switch to it**:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-feature-branch
  ```

- **Switch back to the main branch**:

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  ```

- **Merge the new feature branch into main**:

  ```bash
  git merge new-feature-branch
  ```

## üåê Connecting to the World: Remote Repositories

So far, everything has been on your local machine. To collaborate or to have a
backup of your code, you use remote repositories (like on GitHub).

1. **Add a remote repository**:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
    ```

2. **Push your changes to the remote**:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so next time you can just run `git push`.

## üö´ What Not to Commit: The `.gitignore` File

You don't want to commit every file to your repository. A `.gitignore` file
tells Git which files or folders to ignore.

- **Exclude Secrets**: Sensitive data like API keys and passwords should never be
  committed.
- **Manage Large Files**: Use
  [Git Large File Storage (git-lfs)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for files over
  100MB (like datasets).
- **Omit Temporary Files**: Ignore environment-specific files (`.venv`), cache
  (`.pytest_cache`), logs, and build artifacts (`/dist`).

Here is an example `.gitignore` file:

```text
# https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# Environments
.env
.venv/

# Build artifacts
/dist/
/build/

# Cache
.cache/
.coverage*
.mypy_cache/
.ruff_cache/
.pytest_cache/
__pycache__/

# Editor-specific
.vscode/
.idea/
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Project-specific
/mlruns/*
/outputs/*
!**/.gitkeep

# Python files
*.py[cod]
```

Adhering to these practices ensures your repository remains streamlined and
secure.

## üîë Key Takeaways

- **Version Control is Key**: Git is indispensable for tracking changes,
  collaborating, and maintaining project history.
- **Understand the Workflow**: Master the cycle of modifying, staging, and
  committing changes.
- **Branching for Parallel Development**: Use branches to isolate new features
  or experiments without disrupting the main codebase.
- **Remote Repositories for Collaboration and Backup**: Push your local changes
  to platforms like GitHub for sharing and safekeeping.
- **`.gitignore` for Clean Repositories**: Properly configure `.gitignore` to
  exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from your repository.
