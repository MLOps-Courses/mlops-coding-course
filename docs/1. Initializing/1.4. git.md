# 1.4. Git

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It facilitates tracking changes in source code during software development, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. Git is renowned for its data integrity, flexibility, and support for nonlinear development workflows.

## Why do I need Git?

Git is essential for several reasons:

- **Version Control**: It helps you track and manage changes to your project over time. You can revert files back to a previous state, compare changes over time, and more.
- **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously. It supports branching and merging, enabling teamwork without overwriting each other’s changes.
- **Backup and Restore**: Changes are stored in a repository, providing a backup. You can restore your project to a previous state or recover lost data.
- **Branching and Merging**: With Git, you can branch off from the main project to experiment or work on new features without affecting the main project. Later, these branches can be merged back.

## How can I install Git?

To install Git, visit the [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). This guide provides detailed installation instructions for various operating systems, ensuring you can set up Git regardless of your development environment.

## How should I use Git for my project?

For those new to Git, starting with a basic tutorial, such as [GitHub's Git Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git), is advisable. Here's a quick guide to get you started with Git in your project:

1. **Initialize Git**: Navigate to your project directory and run `git init`. This command creates a new Git repository locally.
2. **Stage Files**: Use `git add <file>` to stage files that you want to include in your next commit. For example, `git add README.md LICENSE.txt`.
3. **Check Status**: `git status` allows you to see which changes are staged, which aren’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.
4. **Commit Changes**: Commit your staged changes with `git commit -m "Initial Commit"`. This records your changes in the repository with a descriptive message.

## Should I commit every file in my project?

It's crucial to be selective about what files you track with Git. Here are some guidelines:

- **Exclude Secrets**: Never commit sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, to your repository.
- **Handle Large Files Carefully**: For files larger than 100MB, consider using Git Large File Storage ([git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)) instead of committing them directly to your Git repository.
- **Avoid Cache Files**: Exclude temporary or environment-specific files (e.g., `.venv`, `poetry.lock`, log files) that do not contribute to the project's core functionality.

To specify files and directories that Git should ignore, create a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory. This file should list patterns matching file names to exclude, such as:

```text
# Example .gitignore content

# Virtual environments
/.venv/

# Jupyter notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Compiled Python files
*.py[cod]
__pycache__/
```

This setup ensures that your repository remains clean and contains only relevant project files, improving clarity and efficiency in your development workflow.
