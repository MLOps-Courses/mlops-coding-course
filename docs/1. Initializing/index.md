# 1. Initializing

The initiation phase of any project sets the groundwork for efficient development, ensuring that all necessary tools and environments are correctly configured. This chapter lays the foundational steps required for a robust development setup tailored for Python projects, emphasizing the importance of a well-prepared environment for MLOps. By methodically progressing through each section, you will establish a comprehensive base, facilitating smooth project advancement and minimizing potential setbacks due to environment misconfigurations.

- **[1.0. System](./1.0. System.md)**: Ensures your system is primed and ready, laying out the prerequisites for installing and running the development tools effectively.
- **[1.1. Python](./1.1. Python.md)**: Introduces the setup of Python, the primary language for our projects, emphasizing version management and environment setup for project isolation.
- **[1.2. pyenv](./1.2. pyenv.md)**: Explores the use of `pyenv` for managing multiple Python versions, enabling you to seamlessly switch between projects with different Python requirements.
- **[1.3. Poetry](./1.3. Poetry.md)**: Delves into `Poetry` for dependency management and packaging, illustrating how it simplifies defining and installing project dependencies.
- **[1.4. git](./1.4. git.md)**: Focuses on `git`, the version control system at the heart of GitHub, detailing how to initiate and manage your repositories effectively.
- **[1.5. GitHub](./1.5. GitHub.md)**: Discusses setting up GitHub for project hosting, version control, and collaboration, underscoring its role in modern software development workflows.
- **[1.6. VS Code](./1.6. VS Code.md)**: Covers the configuration of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), highlighting how to turn this powerful editor into an IDE tailored for Python and MLOps development.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a fully operational development environment, complete with all the tools and configurations necessary for tackling Python-based projects, especially those focused on machine learning and MLOps. This preparation is critical in ensuring that you can focus on development without being hindered by avoidable technical issues.
