# 2.2. Configs

## What are configs?

Configurations, or 'configs', in a notebook are essentially a set of parameters or settings that govern the behavior of your code. They allow for easy modification of key variables without altering the core logic of the notebook. This approach enhances the flexibility and reusability of your code.

Example of configs for a notebook:

```python
# Paths
CACHE_PATH = '../.cache/'
TRAIN_DATA_PATH = '../data/train.csv'
# Randoms
RANDOM_STATE = 0
# Datasets
SHUFFLE = True
TEST_SIZE = 0.2
TARGET = "SalePrice"
# Pipelines
CV = 5
SCORING = "neg_mean_squared_error"
PARAM_GRID = {
    "regressor__max_depth": [12, 15, 18, 21],
    "regressor__n_estimators": [150, 200, 250, 300],
}
```

## Why should I create configs?

Creating configs is a best practice aligned with the principle of avoiding hardcoding values in your code. It makes your code:
- **More Flexible**: Easily adapt to different scenarios or datasets.
- **Easier to Maintain**: Simplify updates and changes without deep code alterations.
- **User-Friendly**: Allow users to adjust the notebook's behavior to their needs without digging into the code.

Configurations act as a 'remote control' for your code, providing an accessible interface for adjustments.

## Which configs can I provide out of the box?

Common configurations in data science projects often include:
- **Data Processing**: Parameters like `SHUFFLE`, `TEST_SIZE`, `RANDOM_STATE` control how data is split and randomized.
- **Model Parameters**: Settings such as `N_ESTIMATORS`, `MAX_DEPTH` for machine learning models.
- **Execution Settings**: `BATCH_SIZE`, `EPOCHS` for iterative processes, and `LIMIT` for dataset size limits.

These settings can be tailored to the specific needs of your project. For instance:

```python
# shuffle your dataset to avoid selection bias
SHUFFLE = False
# define the amount of data reversed for testing
TEST_SIZE = 0.2
# fix the randomness settings to reproduce experiments
RANDOM_STATE = 0
```

## How should I organize the configs in my notebook?

Organizing configurations logically enhances readability and maintainability. Group them by their functionality:

This structured approach helps users and developers quickly locate and adjust settings as needed.
