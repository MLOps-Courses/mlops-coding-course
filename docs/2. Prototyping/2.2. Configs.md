# 2.2. Configs

## What are configs?

Configurations, or 'configs', in a notebook are essentially a set of parameters or settings that govern the behavior of your code. They allow for easy modification of key variables without altering the core logic of the notebook. This approach enhances the flexibility and reusability of your code.

Example of configs for a notebook:

```python
# Paths
CACHE_PATH = '../.cache/'
TRAIN_DATA_PATH = '../data/train.csv'
# Randoms
RANDOM_STATE = 0
# Datasets
SHUFFLE = True
TEST_SIZE = 0.2
TARGET = "SalePrice"
# Pipelines
CV = 5
SCORING = "neg_mean_squared_error"
PARAM_GRID = {
    "regressor__max_depth": [12, 15, 18, 21],
    "regressor__n_estimators": [150, 200, 250, 300],
}
```

## Why should I create configs?

Creating configs is a best practice aligned with the principle of avoiding hardcoding values in your code. It makes your code:
- **More Flexible**: Easily adapt to different scenarios or datasets.
- **Easier to Maintain**: Simplify updates and changes without deep code alterations.
- **User-Friendly**: Allow users to adjust the notebook's behavior to their needs without digging into the code.

Configurations act as a 'remote control' for your code, providing an accessible interface for adjustments.

## Which configs can I provide out of the box?

Common configurations in data science projects often include:
- **Data Processing**: Parameters like `SHUFFLE`, `TEST_SIZE`, `RANDOM_STATE` control how data is split and randomized.
- **Model Parameters**: Settings such as `N_ESTIMATORS`, `MAX_DEPTH` for machine learning models.
- **Execution Settings**: `BATCH_SIZE`, `EPOCHS` for iterative processes, and `LIMIT` for dataset size limits.

These settings can be tailored to the specific needs of your project. For instance:

```python
# shuffle your dataset to avoid selection bias
SHUFFLE = False
# define the amount of data reversed for testing
TEST_SIZE = 0.2
# fix the randomness settings to reproduce experiments
RANDOM_STATE = 0
```

## How should I organize the configs in my notebook?

Organizing configurations logically enhances readability and maintainability. Group them by their functionality:

This structured approach helps users and developers quickly locate and adjust settings as needed.

## Randoms

## Datasets

```

## What are options?

Options in a data science environment, such as a Jupyter notebook, are configurations that tailor the behavior and appearance of libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. These options allow you to control aspects like display settings and output formats.

Example of options in a notebook:

```python
# Pandas
pd.options.display.max_rows = None
pd.options.display.max_columns = None
# Sklearn
set_config(transform_output="pandas")
```

## Why do I need to pass options?

Default settings of libraries may not always align with your specific needs. For example:
- Pandas may hide some columns or rows by default, limiting the visibility of data.
- Matplotlib's default figure sizes might be too small for detailed analysis.

Adjusting these options ensures your environment is optimized for your workflow.

## How should I configure Pandas options?

Pandas offers a variety of options for customizing data display. Check the [Pandas Options and Settings documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/options.html) for a comprehensive guide.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Set the maximum number of rows and columns to display
pd.options.display.max_rows = None
pd.options.display.max_columns = None
# Extend the maximum column width for display
pd.options.display.max_colwidth= None
```

## How should I configure matplotlib options?

Matplotlib's appearance can be customized as per your requirements. Refer to the [Matplotlib Customizing Guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html) for detailed options.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set default figure size
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20, 10)
```

## How should I configure scikit-learn options?

Scikit-learn provides configurations to modify how outputs are displayed or handled. The [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.set_config.html#sklearn.set_config) outlines these options.

```python
import sklearn

# return pandas dataframe instead of numpy array
sklearn.set_config(transform_output='pandas')
```

Setting these options at the beginning of your notebook ensures a consistent and tailored working environment throughout your analysis.
