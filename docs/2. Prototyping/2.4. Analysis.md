## pandas profiling

## How can I explore my dataset content?

Pandas is a popular tool for exploring datasets in Python. Common methods include:
- `.info()`: Overview of types, non-null values, and memory usage.
- `.shape`: Dimensions of the dataframe.
- `.describe()`: Descriptive statistics.

For visual exploration, libraries like [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [ydata-profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) are useful.
