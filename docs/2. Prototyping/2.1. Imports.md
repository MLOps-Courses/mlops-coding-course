#  Imports

In this chapter, we will set up all the imports that we will need for our project. This is a crucial first step to ensure we have all the necessary tools and configurations loaded into our environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations

We will start by importing the configurations that we defined in the `params.py` file. This file centralizes our project's parameters, making them easy to manage and modify.

```python
from params import *
```

This will import all the variables that we defined in the `params.py` file, so that we can use them in our notebook. While using `*` is convenient for interactive development in notebooks, it's generally not recommended for production scripts, as it can make it unclear where variables are coming from.

## üìö Libraries

Next, we will import all the libraries that we will need for our project. We will group them by their purpose to keep our code organized.

### Data Manipulation and Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```
- **Pandas (`pd`)**: The cornerstone for data manipulation in Python. We'll use it to load and work with our dataset in a tabular format called a DataFrame.
- **NumPy (`np`)**: The fundamental package for numerical computation in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Data Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
- **Matplotlib (`plt`)**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn (`sns`)**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Machine Learning

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
```
- **scikit-learn (`sklearn`)**: The go-to library for machine learning in Python. We are importing:
    - `train_test_split`: A function to split our data into training and testing sets.
    - `RandomForestClassifier`: The machine learning model we will use for our classification task.
    - `accuracy_score`, `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`: Metrics to evaluate the performance of our model.

## üíæ Dataset

Finally, we will load the dataset that we will be using for our project. We'll use the `DATA_PATH` variable we imported from our configurations.

```python
df = pd.read_csv(f'{DATA_PATH}/obesity.csv')
```

### Initial Inspection

After loading the dataset, it's a good practice to take a quick look at its structure and content.

- **`.head()`**: Shows the first few rows of the DataFrame.
- **`.info()`**: Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types and non-null values.

```python
df.head()
```

```python
df.info()
```

## üîë Key Takeaways

- **Centralized Configuration**: Keeping parameters in a separate file (`params.py`) makes your project cleaner and easier to manage.
- **Organized Imports**: Grouping imports by their function (e.g., data manipulation, visualization, machine learning) improves code readability.
- **Know Your Tools**: Understanding the role of each library (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`) is fundamental to effective data science work.
- **Immediate Inspection**: Always perform a quick check of your data after loading it to ensure it has been read correctly and to get a first sense of its structure.
