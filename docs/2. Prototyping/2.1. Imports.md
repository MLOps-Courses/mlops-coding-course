# 2.1. Imports

## What are code imports?

Code imports in Python are directives that allow you to include and use functionality from external libraries or modules within your project. They are essential for accessing a wide range of capabilities that Python and its ecosystem offer.

According to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports), imports should be grouped in the following order:
1. **Standard Library Imports**: Built-in Python modules (e.g., os, sys, math).
2. **Related Third Party Imports**: External libraries installed via package managers (e.g., numpy, pandas).
3. **Local Application/Library Specific Imports**: Modules or packages specific to your project.

Example of code imports in a notebook:

```python
import os # standard
import pandas as pd # external
from my_project import my_module # local
```

## Which packages do I need for my project?

For a data science project, there are several key packages available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

- **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
- **[plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**: A versatile library for machine learning.

Install these using poetry:

```bash
$ poetry add pandas plotly scikit-learn
```

*Note*: Ensure you're in the correct [virtual environment](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/) linked to your project.

## How should I organize my imports to facilitate my work?

Organizing imports is a matter of preference and project standards. Importing entire modules (e.g., `import pandas as pd`) is often recommended for clarity. It helps in identifying the module origin of functions/classes and in adjusting imports as your code evolves.

```python
# import module
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import ensemble
model = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()

# import functions/classes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier
```

## Are there any side effects when importing modules in Python?

Yes, importing a module in Python can have side effects because the entire module's code is executed upon import. This behavior can be beneficial or potentially harmful. Hence, it's crucial to:
- Only import trustworthy packages.
- Be cautious about unintended side effects in your own modules.
- Clearly document any intentional side effects.

Example of risky behavior:

```python
# In a module, a potentially harmful operation could be triggered
# lib.py
import os
os.system("rm -rf /")  # Dangerous command!

# main.py
import lib  # Executing lib.py could lead to data loss
```

## What should I do if packages cannot be imported from my notebook?

If a package isn't importing correctly, it's often due to the Python interpreter's inability to locate it. This is common when working with virtual environments. To troubleshoot, check the interpreter path and module search paths in your notebook:

```python
import sys
print("Interpreter path:", sys.executable)
print("Module search paths:", sys.path)
```

Adjusting these paths or ensuring the correct virtual environment is active can resolve import issues.
