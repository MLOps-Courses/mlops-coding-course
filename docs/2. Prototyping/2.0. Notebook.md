# 2.0. Notebook

## What is a notebook?

A notebook, typically with the extension `.ipynb`, is an interactive document combining source code, explanatory text, and output. Stored as a JSON file on the disk, it transforms into an intuitive interface in IDEs, displaying code cells, narrative text, visualizations, and results in an integrated format.

## Why should I use a notebook for prototyping?

Notebooks are particularly suited for prototyping due to their interactive nature:
- **Interactive Development**: Allows for real-time code execution and immediate feedback.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Ideal for data scientists to experiment with different approaches swiftly.
- **Visualization Support**: Seamlessly integrates data visualizations alongside code.

*Note*: As an alternative, consider the [Python Interactive Window](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) in VS Code, if your code editor supports it.

## Can I use my notebook instead of creating a Python package?

While notebooks are convenient for initial stages, they have limitations for scalable software development:
- **Mixed Content**: Merging code and output can be messy and less readable.
- **Non-Sequential Flow**: The execution order isn't inherently linear, leading to potential confusion.
- **Code Review Challenges**: Difficult to conduct thorough code reviews and implement unit tests.
- **Lack of Reusability**: Doesn't naturally encourage the development of reusable code structures like classes and functions.

For robust development, transitioning from notebooks to more structured Python packages is advisable.

## Do I need to review this section even if I know how to use notebooks?
