# MLOps Coding Course

**Welcome to the MLOps Coding Course!**

This course is designed to dive deep into the intersection of software development and data science, focusing on the practical applications of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) projects using Python.

Whether you are a beginner eager to explore or an experienced professional seeking to enhance your skill set, this course offers valuable insights and hands-on experience.

## Key Features

- **Hands-on Python Coding**: Learn to code with Python in a way that's directly applicable to real-world AI projects.
- **Project-Driven Learning**: Each chapter includes practical project instructions to help you apply what you've learned.
- **MLOps Techniques**: Gain insights into effective MLOps coding strategies that streamline the development and deployment of AI/ML models.
- **Open Source Tools**: Familiarize yourself with industry-standard tools like [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/), [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Course Content

1. **Initializing**: Set up your development environment, manage Python versions, and handle external dependencies.
2. **Prototyping**: Use Jupyter notebooks for ML prototyping, explore dataset manipulation, and perform initial model assessments.
3. **Productionizing**: Transition from notebooks to clean Python packages, learn about modular coding, and understand different programming paradigms.
4. **Validating**: Focus on code quality with typing, linting, testing, and debugging to ensure your ML projects are robust and maintainable.
5. **Refining**: Dive into advanced MLOps techniques including CI/CD workflows, software containers, and model registries to streamline your operations.
6. **Sharing**: Learn how to effectively organize and document your MLOps projects to ensure they are accessible and collaborative.
